AB To inform the development of gamified assessments, this study explored how students with or at risk for reading difficulties in Grades 6-8 (N = 202) perceived and interacted with a decoding assessment designed with gamification characteristics. Three data sources enhanced the methodological triangulation: observations and scores from testing, surveys of students' perceptions, and focus group discussions with a stratified random sample of students (n = 25). Findings suggest students became immersed in the gamified reading assessment and were motivated by tasks that were challenging but not frustratingly difficult. However, they were dissatisfied with some design features and reported focusing on identifying patterns and gaming strategies rather than on the reading skills being assessed. This suggests students' expectations of gamified assessments might contribute construct irrelevant variance to the instruments.

AB The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the effects of Gamified-Assessment Tools (GAT) used in formal educational settings on student academic achievement. We used PRISMA systematic procedures to screen the articles across Web of Science, ERIC, Scopus, Pubmed, and PsycArticles databases. We identified 23 independent results from 17 primary studies with academic achievement outcomes using GAT in formal educational settings. These primary studies accounted for a total of N = 2836 (n = 1318 in GAT, n = 1518 in control) participants. We evaluated publication bias and quality assurance of selected studies for the validity and reliability of our meta-analysis results. Publication bias was not determined as a threat to overall Effect Size (ES). We employed Random-Effects Models (REM) to calculate the overall effect size. According to the REM, the overall effect of the GAT on academic achievement was calculated as g = .62 at the medium level. We also examined the learner stage, learning domain, sync type of assessment tools, research design, and assessment tool as moderators in which GAT may be effective. ESs of GAT significantly differed according to the learner stage. GAT had a larger ES on academic achievement in higher education than K12. There were no significant differences in the ESs of the GAT for other moderators. Quizizz, which is the most effective assessment tool according to our results, has a large ES on academic achievement. Especially in K-12, more experimental research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of GAT.

AB The Millennial Generation is entering the Higher Education (hereinafter HE) with expectations of Higher Teaching and Learning. Correspondingly, the HE institutions have attempted to make their pedagogy student-centred. This paper argues that there is scope for a gamified, student-centred assessment regime that would lead to higher levels of student engagement. Such assessment regime would utilise gaming principles and personal narratives to engage students. This work argues that the underlying gamified narrative based pedagogy has the potential to be universal and interdisciplinary. The assessment regime suggested was implemented in two different contexts and within two different subdisciplines with two different student cohorts producing mixed results. The validity of this pedagogy, especially its universality claim, is critically examined in light of these results.

AB Background.Keeping high school students engaged and motivated to learn complex scientific concepts can be difficult and challenging; this is especially true if the task feels daunting and unfamiliar to the students. Incorporating educational technology, such as KAHOOT, into the classroom can help students learn scientific material even when it is difficult. Aim. Our objective is to determine the effectiveness of gamification in an Advanced Placement Biology (AP biology) classroom by using the online game 'KAHOOT!' as a supplement to traditional teacher-centered learning. In addition, we determine the use of 'KAHOOT!' in enhancing student engagement and the learning experience for biology. Methods. A presentation on Transcription and Translation was given to a small group of high school AP Biology students (n = 18, 18 women). After the presentation, the students were given 15 questions and twenty seconds to answer each question in the 'KAHOOT!' game. Both the students and the teacher were given a post-activity survey to assess their interest in the activity. Results. Based on the responses in the Students' Survey, 'KAHOOT!' can be used as a gamified assessment tool to help students learn the topic of 'Transcription and Translation' by actively engaging them in a fun and exciting manner. Conclusion. The overall activity had a positive impact on the students and teacher as the students enjoyed learning Transcription and Translation through the use of 'KAHOOT!'.

DE Quizizz; gamification; formative assessment; EFL; grammar; vocabulary
AB The revolution of this current digital era has led to changes in the way how teaching is done. An example is that game-based tech tools have been widely integrated in English as Foreign Language (EFL) formative assessment processes carried out in the classrooms. As this technology is introduced rapidly is crucial to evaluate if it brings real benefits to education. For that, the main aim of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of the use of Quizizz online learning application in enhancing students' performance by comparing it to the traditional pen-to-paper exercises in grammar and vocabulary lessons. In this work, two groups of Ecuadorian students majoring software engineering enrolled in Module 2 of the English Language Program in 2019 at one Ecuadorian university were selected. A Pre-experimental design was employed in which one class participated as control group and the other as experimental group. In the last stage of the lessons, participants in the control group were asked to complete exercises in the book or in worksheets; on the other hand, students in the experimental group were required to join to Quizizz live games monitored by the teacher and from which they obtained immediate feedback after each question. After the treatment period, tests were taken by both groups. The results show score differences between students who worked with Quizizz in their learning process and their counterparts. The independent t-test at the 0.05 level of significance was utilized to determine if the differences found are statistically significant. As using gamified assessment tools in EFL instruction constitutes a growing area of research, some possible influencing factors for these findings are discussed in this paper.

AB Educational games are assumed to be an effective and efficient instructional strategy for computing education. However, it is essential to systematically evaluate such games in order to obtain sound evidence of their impact. Thus, the objective of this article is to present the state of the art on how games for computing education are evaluated. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 3617 articles from which 112 relevant articles have been identified, describing 117 studies on the evaluation of games for computing education. Based on these studies we analyzed how evaluations are defined (the analysis factors evaluated, research designs, evaluation models/methods used, kind of data collection instruments, etc.), how they have been executed (sample size and replications) and analyzed (data analysis methods used). As a result, we can confirm that most evaluations use a simple research design in which, typically, the game is used and afterwards subjective feedback is collected via questionnaires from the learners. The majority of the evaluations are run with small samples, without replication, using mostly qualitative methods for data analysis. We also observed that most studies do not use a well-defined evaluation model or method. This shows that there is a need for more rigorous evaluations as well as methodological support in order to assist game creators and instructors to improve such games as well as to systematically support decisions on when or how to include them within instructional units.

AB Purpose - There is no argument that using games (gamification) is an efficient way of learning in higher education. The questions, though, are which gamification approach is most suitable at that level and how to assess its suitability? This paper aims to attempt to partially answer these two questions, in the context of lean thinking education.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper offers an assessment criteria to investigate the impact of lean gamification based on the evaluation of motivational, cognitive and social processing during games. In addition, a study is conducted among selected games using these assessment criteria. The study included statistical as well as comparative analysis. The study was based on a sample of undergraduate students learning various lean thinking concepts through physical games over the course of six months.
   Findings - Results showed different interaction levels between the three evaluation criteria depending on the type and design of the lean game. The reported scores and analysis drew various lessons on how to use gamification in the context of lean teaching, outlined some best practices in lean games design and suggested recommendations in mapping lean games from industrial domain to higher education domain.
   Research limitations/implications - The scope of this research was bounded by the sample size of students as well as the selected nine lean thinking games. Larger pool of students as well as other lean thinking games can offer further insights and confirm the outlined ones.
   Practical implications - The presented work will help lean thinking educators in higher education to better understand the student dynamics associated with engaging them in this type pf pedagogical approach. It will help guiding lean thinking games' designer on how to better cater for this segment of lean thinking learners. Finally, it will aid in promoting lean gamification as an effective learning tool.
   Social implications - The social impact is achieved through enhancing lean thinking education to a wide number of students. This will positively impact the society through the application of the effective lean tools at different stages, levels and places in these students' life experiences.
   Originality/value - This study offers one of the very few applications in gamification assessment in the context of lean thinking. Furthermore, it integrates the social processing criterion for the first time with the classical two other criteria (motivation and cognitive) used in games education assessment. Finally, it offers new insights for lean thinking game designers for higher education learners.

AB Purpose: New technologies like gamification are continuously integrated into medical education during the last years. However, the benefit and implementation of such gaming platforms are not clearly studied. This analysis assesses the feasibility of Kahoot! regarding simplicity and low-cost performance as a learning/teaching tool for medical education in (histo-)pathology.
   Materials and Methods: In this feasibility pilot study, we developed 36 modules for different benign and malignant tumors, covering four major topics: gastrointestinal tract, dermatology, urogenital tract, and hematology. Each module included histomorphological text-based questions for education of 2nd-year medical students. The online gaming-platform Kahoot! was anonymously implemented before and after "classical" medical education which included discussions of histological slides for each tumor entity using Microsoft PowerPoint-based presentations in combination with microscopical demonstrations. Participating students were invited to a seven-questions evaluation about the online educational approach.
   Results: Overall, 23 of 51 students of the study class completed the pre- and the post-evaluation of Kahoot! in one or more organ systems. The percentage of correct answers increased from the initial mean/median of 47.2/45% to 77.2/76.3%. Simultaneously, the time for answering questions decreased by roughly 50% (from mean/median time of 9.1/8.3 seconds to 5.1/4.3 seconds) from pre- to post-assessment. The results were independent of gender; however, there were scoring differences between the different organ systems. Students positively evaluated the routine implementation of the gaming-platform Kahoot! within medical education.
   Conclusion: Kahoot! is as a simple, direct, and low-cost application in medical teaching improving learning outcomes of pathomorphological topics with high acceptance by students. Kahoot!-based evaluations should be also performed in more advanced topics in the field of histopathology.

AB In recent years, an increasing interest has been observed in the development and use of simulations, serious games (SGs) and gamification strategies to teach software project management (SPM) in a highly practical way. The current SGs for SPM have a quite specific scope, are not able to provide and dynamically change game scenarios during the life of the SG and do not allow teachers to assess students' new skills automatically. These weaknesses led to the development of ProDec, a simulation-based SG that is able to incorporate SPM real-life practice. In this study, the authors discuss the use of SGs in SPM education before they describe ProDecAdmin, the game scenario design tool for ProDec. ProDecAdmin provides teachers with an environment for designing the game scenarios for ProDec. Additionally, it helps teachers establish the assessment criteria to automate the students' assessment during the game plays. These functionalities allow ProDec to offer students any game scenario that teachers design and to assess their performance in them. Hence, the tool ProDecAdmin helps the SG ProDec to overcome the lack of flexibility and automatic assessment identified in the current SGs for SPM. This study also outlines the results of the usability evaluation conducted.

AB The use of gamification in education and specifically in e-learning environments has been an exponential increase from 2014. Currently coexist more than 10,000 mobile applications (apps) that intermingle instructional design, educational content and playful interaction elements. However, there is no consensus in the scientific community about how to evaluate and assess Games Based Learning (GBL) of these platforms. This research aims to apply the Theoretical Integrated Gamification Model Environments E-Learning (E-MIGA) at 10 apps with more downloads in AppStore (IOS) and PlayStore (Android), through a judgment of 30 experts in the field of e-learning and gamification, to transform this theoretical model into an instrument of Quantifiable dimensions and indicators. A pilot with scores drawn from expert judgment apps aforementioned test is then applied. It follows that neither test mobile applications analyzed education has received an excellent score of 62 points, although several of them as Memrise, Kahoot and Duolingo fully comply with 72% of the values set by the indicators.

ID GAMIFICATION
AB The process of converting non-game educational content and processes into game-like educational content and processes is called gamification. This article describes a gamified evaluation software for university students in Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) courses, based on competence profiles of students and problems. The traditional learning management systems and learning tools cannot handle gamification to its full potential because of the unique requirements of gamified environments. We designed a novel gamification evaluation and assessment methodology implemented in a STEAM course through specially designed software. The results from end-user tests show a positive expectation of students' performance and motivation. The preliminary results of over 100 students in the Fundamentals of Computer Graphics course are presented and the results of quantitative analysis are discussed. In addition we present an analysis of students' surveys, where students expressed in free text form observations about the software.

AB (1) Background: There is a scarcity of data regarding game-based learning (GBL) in experiential pharmacy education; in addition, the impact of educational games on the attainment of intended learning outcomes and students' motivation to actively learn and practice through non-traditional pedagogical tools are yet to be explored. (2) Methods: This was a prospective quasi-experimental study that introduced GBL into the Pharmacy Practice Experience course of the Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) program at the Lebanese International University in Lebanon. Data collection took place between July and September 2021. The study objectives were to assess the impact of GBL on attaining intended learning outcomes, determine students' motivation to engage in GBL, and assess the impact of this motivation on the attainment of learning outcomes. (3) Results: GBL was associated with a significantly higher exam average (mean difference = 7.152, p < 0.001). Moreover, an active learning motivation assessment scale (ALMAS) was constructed and validated; it was found to have good reliability as well as high sensitivity and specificity, and it determined a good level of motivation to engage in GBL. Game-based learners with higher motivation scores had significantly higher exam averages compared to those with lower scores (Beta = 0.296, 95% CI 0.110-0.545, p = 0.004). (4) Conclusion: GBL was associated with better attainment of intended learning outcomes. Students appear to be motivated to learn by this style of active learning, and motivation is prognostic of the attainment of learning outcomes.

AB The use of digital games in education is already a reality, but their use in this area has been hampered by the lack of consolidated resources for evaluation of game-based learning. This paper reports a computational architecture for learning analytics in game-based learning that is based on relational analysis and data mining of data containing evidences of learning collected during the game play. It also uses computer vision techniques applied on images of the players playing to obtain information about their behaviors and emotions during the game.

AB In the pedagogical process, a serious game acts as a method of teaching and upbringing, the transfer of accumulated experience and knowledge. In this paper, we describe an interactive serious programming game based on game-based learning for teaching JavaScript programming in an introductory course at university. The game was developed by adopting the gamification pattern-based approach. The game is based on visualizations of different types of algorithms, which are interpreted in the context of city life. The game encourages interactivity and pursues deeper learning of programming concepts. The results of the evaluation of the game using pre-test and post-test knowledge assessment, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model (TETEM) are presented.

AB Digital education game not only can be used as a teacher of learning media but also can be used as a teacher instrument in the assessment/assessment of learning. The purpose of this research is to develop and implement digital educational game product to be used as an alternative assessment instrument on science lesson in junior high school. The development research model used is ADDIE with the stages of Analisys, Design, Development & Production, Implementation, Evaluation. In the early development stage the game's draft was validated by media and material experts. In the implementation phase, a limited trial was conducted in SMP Muhammadiyah 1 Purwokerto and SMP Negeri 1 Purwokerto. The data obtained were then analyzed using descriptive data analysis to process game quality data. The results showed that the teacher's assessment of digital game-based test instruments was in a very good range. The results of the assessment of the general quality of the game also showed good results until very well. Students give a positive response to the implementation of digital games in learning science in the classroom. The conclusion of this study is that digital education games that are prepared are feasible to be used as an alternative assessment instrument of science learning in junior high schools.

AB Based on the SSCI sub-database in the Web of Science, this study selected 9 SSCI journals in the field of educational technology as sources of literature to investigate the empirical research of educational games from 2013 to 2017. We used the bibliometric method to analyze and describe the overall development of educational game research. It was found that the research hotspots mainly focus on educational game environment design, educational game effectiveness, learner motivation, and gamification teaching strategies. A content analysis framework was established based on the results of the bibliometric analysis. From the three dimensions of educational game design and development, teaching and application, and educational evaluation, a total of 113 empirical studies were analyzed panoramically. The following characteristics and trends were summarized: (1) design and development: focus on high-quality learning experiences and personalized learning; (2) games used in education: a shift from the perspective of learner characteristics to internal cognition; (3) integration of games and teaching: educational games as the main cognitive tools for the learner-centered classroom; (4) educational evaluation: the continuous exploration of gamification evaluation methods to achieve scientific, interesting, and effective assessment.

ID DESIGN; ENGAGEMENT; REWARDS
AB Digital games are recently in constant debate in the educational community on issues such as promoting media education and learning as well as engaging students in activities that enforce subject cognition and effective collaboration learning assignments. At the same time, these particular principles 'serve' the trend of the Media Education. Hence contemporary changes in the wider media field require a re-evaluation of the fundamental aims and methods of media education - not just as far as the content of the curriculum is concerned, but also in terms of a pedagogical method process. In this article, based on the above framework, the researchers are trying to portray the implementation and evaluation of a learning and teaching scenario, in which learners-primary school students are gradually exposed to the role of a video digital games evaluator, learning about them, playing them and gradually setting up the evaluation criteria through the constant coordination of the teacher-facilitator. As a culmination of their efforts, the students evaluate the digital games they selected and played as well as create an on-line journal, on which they demonstrate in both numerical and descriptive ways their outcomes. Via the utilisation of specific guidelines and evaluation criteria to be defined by them, students, evaluate and formulate a review of the characteristics of their favourite video game. Subsequently, based on the assessment panel they compose an analysis, describing the characteristics of the digital games in question as well as attempt to provide advice to prospective users-players on their correct educational integration. Although limitations existed on mapping the evaluation criteria and guiding the students to adopt and promote the required competences, the attractiveness of the tasks in question connected and supported by the careful pre-planning of the scenario seemed to aid the effectiveness of the project. New competences and knowledge developed such as a critical eye on the digital games, evaluation techniques on digital games in learning settings as well as enhancement of cognition on certain issues and subjects.

AB Parallels between good gaming and good learning experiences [Gee, J. 2003] suggest the use of computer games in the education sector. This paper illustrates a framework to aid in the design, implementation and deployment of mobile device based serious games. Key concepts of games based learning are identified and an argument is made for the use of mobile technologies as platform for serious games. The proposed framework specifically considers the formalisation of learning targets, the assessment and evaluation of the game and the players alike as well as how to personalise games to suit individual players. The overall framework and the individual steps are illustrated and the reader is provided with instructions as well as examples of games and applications that can (and have) benefited from the framework.

AB This paper describes a case study of how Agent Oriented Agile Based (AOAB) development methodology was implemented in mobile computing module to create game as a part of the module assessment requirements. Games can be used in higher education in many ways to increase students participation, enable variation in how lectures are taught and to increase students interest when they create their own game. We provide a new game development methodology and integrated with mobile computing module.
   The experience described in this paper is based on the feedback from the module staff member, students feedback, final student report and finally module evaluation report by students. The evaluation shows that the students who used AOAB methodology provide a better result rather than groups who used Agile game development methodology in game creation.
   Finally, we describe the benefit of using game in higher education and how we could enhance students progress in their study.

ID SERIOUS GAMES
AB As a current trend in teaching, simulation games play an active and important role in the area of technology-based education. Simulation games create an environment for scholars to solve real-world problems in a risk-free environment. Therefore, they aim to increase the knowledge base as well as learning experiences for students. However, assessing the effectiveness of a simulation game is necessary to optimize elements of the game and increase their learning effect. In order to achieve this aim, different evaluation methods exist, which do not always involve all phases when running a simulation game. In this study, we conduct a literature review to analyze evaluation methods for three phases: pre-game, in-game, post-game phases of simulation games. Thirty-one peer-reviewed research papers met specified selection criteria and were classified according to a didactic framework that illustrates the four phases of running simulation games: Preparation, Introduction, Interaction and Conclusion. Based on the results, we provide a concrete evaluation strategy that will be a guide to assess simulation games during all the phases. This study contributes to the theory by providing an overview of methods for simulation game assessment within the different game phases. It contributes to the practice by providing a concrete evaluation strategy that can be adapted and used to assess simulation games.

AB In engineering disciplines, visualization can provide an essential mode to facilitate student understanding of important and abstract concepts. Learning through a medium that combines course materials with game characteristics can be a powerful tool for education. This approach is expected to improve student willingness to learn, which will in turn increase the interests of high school and undergraduate students towards engineering as a future career.
   In this paper, three teaching modules based on the Gaming and Interactive Visualization for Education (GIVE) in three universities will be described in detail with enhanced game characteristics. Also, using the newly developed assessment tools, the evaluation data from the students who have experienced the GIVE system will be analyzed. More specifically, the three modules are designed and illustrated in this paper for the Flight Mechanics, Introduction to Electrical Engineering, and Design and Manufacturing.
   The following game characteristics have been considered and implemented in the modules: progressively balanced goal, feedback, time sensitive scoring, adaptive scoring, meaningful visual presentation, emotional involvement, avoiding guess, constitutive rule, operational rule, background, challenges, and rewards.
   Along with the course module development and implementation, the outcomes have been assessed using our evaluation system. The results have been analyzed and suggestions have been given for future work.

ID EDUCATION
AB Nowadays, one of the learning resources in the educational area are serious games, also called training games; they are games designed with a different purpose than fun, whose main objective is to reinforce the new concepts more creatively. However, not all existing serious games are accessible in a way that allows access to a more significant number of users. Therefore, this research proposes to apply a combined method to evaluate accessibility in serious games, considering the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. As a case study, we evaluated the accessibility of 82 serious games developed by Physical Education Technology Interactive Simulations at the University of Colorado. We propose to replicate this combined method for users with various types of disabilities, considering the various accessibility barriers. As future work, we suggest generating an accessibility heuristic evaluation focused on serious games, based on the accessibility issues identified. Finally, we believe it is essential to strengthen accessibility policies in each country, as well as implement best practices that generate innovation by incorporating diversity in building and designing more inclusive serious games.

AB Using games is a new and a powerful way of learning in the classrooms, where students are active participants in the learning process. Educational games empower students' knowledge and skills, as well as educational value of the teaching process. There are plenty of serious games that can be used in education, but most of them simply do not hold interest among students. Thus, the students do not really accept them as games, which creates opposite effect than expected. There are other factors that influence the successful game's integration in the classroom - teachers' digital competences, technical (pre)requirements for the game, educational value of the game.
   This paper presents a methodological tool based on an evaluation framework for integration of digital games into education (MEDGE). The evaluation framework uses different data gathering techniques such as: surveys, exams, observation, reflection, in order to obtain data. This methodological tool is simplified version of an evaluation framework, developed to act as a subjective, but efficient tool for teachers in order to make initial evaluation of the potential introduction of certain educational game in the classroom.
   The tool establishes step by step methodology for evaluation of educational games. It starts with determining the technical requirements of a game, accordance to students' age and teachers' digital competences needed to play it in the classroom. If these conditions are met, the game evaluation continues by determining game's ease of use, its educational value, students' quality of experience, game's alignment with educational goals and teacher subjective preferences toward using the game in the classroom.
   The proposed methodology was tested by more than 62 teachers from Croatia, Macedonia, Norway, Estonia, Germany and Poland. The teachers were asked to evaluate at least two educational games using this methodological tool. One of those games was Kahoot, a popular game within the teachers' community. Kahoot is a quiz based game that can be used for initial, formative and summative assessment of students' knowledge using individual or collaborative team work mode. The other game was selected by teachers based on their needs and experiences.
   Using a survey with five-point Likert scale, information concerning teachers' attitudes towards usefulness of the methodology, its complexity, applicability in the classroom, and usefulness for evaluation of a game were obtained. The participants had the opportunity to give comments and express their opinion concerning the proposed methodological tool. The paper is consisted of detailed description of the developed methodological approach, together with the use cases and results of the survey on usage of the methodological evaluation tool.

AB The main purpose of this study was to develop a mobile game-based math learning APP for the learners of elementary school. The study adopted gradual prompting of dynamic assessment to design a digital role-playing game for the students to learn number and calculation concepts. The learners have to solve the math problems for finishing the challenging mission in the process of this digital game playing. When they encounter difficulties in the game playing, the APP will offer real-time intervention gradually for assisting them to break through the challenge. After finishing the system, this study conducted an expert evaluation and learning experiment. The evaluation results revealed that the experts showed high appraisal toward this APP and the learners expressed their high interest and willing to use it.

AB This study proposed an online learning system for energy education, modifying the typical rules of tictac-toe and incorporating multiple choice tests into the game in order to develop a game-based formative assessment tool for an online learning course. In order to explore how different gaming modes and feedback types in this game-based formative assessment affect knowledge acquisition effectiveness and participation perceptions, a tic-tac-toe quiz game (TRIS-Q) with two gaming modes: single-player online game (SOG) and multi-player online game (MOG), and two feedback types: immediate elaborated feedback (IEF) and no immediate elaborated feedback (no IEF), were developed. A 2(SOG vs. MOG) x 2(IEF vs. no IEF) between-subject experiment was also conducted to investigate the effects on 109 ninth-grade students from four junior high school classes. The research findings indicated that different gaming modes of TRIS-Q did not affect the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition; providing IEF for each question answered in the game facilitated the enhancement of both energy knowledge acquisition and student tic-tac-toe ability when comparing it with the no IEF type. Additionally, the different gaming modes and feedback types did not affect participation perceptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB following the rapid advancement in technologies and computer capabilities, researchers have predicted that more technology-enhanced learning will occur and educational computer games (Serious Games) in particular could play an important part in education. Research has shown that for serious games to be effective as learning tools, they have to provide an engaging experience to the player. However, very few evidence-based research have been carried out to discover the features of games that make it suitable for learning, how the actual learning can be evaluated and more especially, the gender divide that still exists between females and males in the world of gaming. This research aims to determine the educational features necessary to make a serious game effective as a learning tool, develop an assessment framework for the evaluation of serious games as well as determine if some of the educational features and engagement factors are peculiar to females.

   assessment
AB The gamification neologism is applied to using game-thinking and game mechanics to solve problems and to engage audiences. In the previous year we applied the concept in the context of the Higher Education, in the course of computer science. We used several game design mechanisms in several aspects of the learning process. A reward mechanism was central to the gamification approach, providing automatic classification of students and constant and up-to-date feedback of their progress within the course.
   Each chapter of the course's content was mapped to a level, in a total of five. The student had to complete all the levels to be able to succeed in the course. Each level provided three difficult levels, which the student could choose and, according to this choice, adopt a classification grade.
   Several learning experiences were designed. Centered in the student, the learning experiences were designed to be active, meaningful, with social meaning, integrative, and diversified, giving the student the main learning role. The inherent increase in complexity demands the integration of different dimensions of knowledge, better achieved through diversified strategies. In this sense, we designed traditional practical assignment exercises in parallel with educational games, including card games, board games, tabletop role-playing games and quizzes.
   Although adopting gamification for the learning process of higher education students promises increasing motivation and autonomy, it may also provide a clash within the student, because of the pedagogical paradigm shift. Not all students have playing experience of even like to play games. Of course it may be argued that not al students like to read, research and experiment or, more generally, not all students like to study, and this has not made learning impossible to happen. However, the gamification opportunity is to provide rich and motivational experiences that can increase the involvement of students and, consequently, the depth of learning, which is more successful if students are engaged.
   In this context, the assessment of this pedagogical experience is fundamental. On one hand, it allows the teacher and the institution to evaluate the success of the paradigm shift and, on the other hand, it provides a mean for students to become part of the process, by including them in the design of the learning experiences. To be as thorough as possible, the assessment methodology includes a quantitative analysis, in the form of a final questionnaire, a qualitative approach, based on an initial interview to measure the perceptions and the perspective of students concerning the pedagogical methodologies in Higher Education, several class observation procedures and game analysis and assessment. All of these forms contribute to build a solid notion of the success of the gamification for Higher Education learning process.

AB Engineering education needs to focus on equipping students with foundational math, science, and engineering skills, with development of critical and higher-order thinking so they can address novel and complex problems and challenges. Learning through a medium that combines course materials with game characteristics can be a powerful tool for engineering education. Games need to be designed for higher order engagement with students, which go beyond remembering, understanding and applying of engineering concepts. In this paper, we present design, development, implementation, and evaluation of a game for engineers. The developed game is founded on experiential learning theory and uses enhanced game characteristics. The racecar game has been designed to facilitate higher-order learning of geometric tolerancing concepts. The course module has been developed and implemented, with assessment of outcomes. The results show that students using the game module, when compared with the control group (lecture-based instruction), had significant improvements when addressing questions that involved higher-order cognition. Survey results also indicate positive student attitudes towards the learning experience with game modules.

AB Background: Serious games involving virtual patients in medical education can provide a controlled setting within which players can learn in an engaging way, while avoiding the risks associated with real patients. Moreover, serious games align with medical students' preferred learning styles. The Virtual Emergency TeleMedicine (VETM) game is a simulation-based game that was developed in collaboration with the mEducator Best Practice network in response to calls to integrate serious games in medical education and training. The VETM game makes use of data from an electrocardiogram to train practicing doctors, nurses, or medical students for problem-solving in real-life clinical scenarios through a telemedicine system and virtual patients. The study responds to two gaps: the limited number of games in emergency cardiology and the lack of evaluations by professionals.
   Objective: The objective of this study is a quantitative, professional feedback-informed evaluation of one scenario of VETM, involving cardiovascular complications. The study has the following research question: "What are professionals' perceptions of the potential of the Virtual Emergency Telemedicine game for training people involved in the assessment and management of emergency cases?"
   Methods: The evaluation of the VETM game was conducted with 90 professional ambulance crew nursing personnel specializing in the assessment and management of emergency cases. After collaboratively trying out one VETM scenario, participants individually completed an evaluation of the game (36 questions on a 5-point Likert scale) and provided written and verbal comments. The instrument assessed six dimensions of the game: (1) user interface, (2) difficulty level, (3) feedback, (4) educational value, (5) user engagement, and (6) terminology. Data sources of the study were 90 questionnaires, including written comments from 51 participants, 24 interviews with 55 participants, and 379 log files of their interaction with the game.
   Results: Overall, the results were positive in all dimensions of the game that were assessed as means ranged from 3.2 to 3.99 out of 5, with user engagement receiving the highest score (mean 3.99, SD 0.87). Users' perceived difficulty level received the lowest score (mean 3.20, SD 0.65), a finding which agrees with the analysis of log files that showed a rather low success rate (20.6%). Even though professionals saw the educational value and usefulness of the tool for pre-hospital emergency training (mean 3.83, SD 1.05), they identified confusing features and provided input for improving them.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results of the professional feedback-informed evaluation of the game provide a strong indication of its potential as an educational tool for emergency training. Professionals' input will serve to improve the game. Further research will aim to validate VETM, in a randomized pre-test, post-test control group study to examine possible learning gains in participants' problem-solving skills in treating a patient's symptoms in an emergency situation.

AB The Playground Game is a web-based game that was developed for teaching research methods and statistics to nursing and social sciences students in higher education and vocational training. The complexity and abstract nature of research methods and statistics poses many challenges for students. The Playground Game aims to address this issue and bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing students with a playful practical problem case that they have to analyse and evaluate: the player's task is to make substantiated judgements about a study that was carried out to decide upon the most suitable location for laying out a children's playground in a fictitious town. This paper reports about the evaluation of the Playground Game among 103 students of the bachelor psychology programme from Leuven University. A pre-questionnaire preceding the game was used to collect information about the students ' individual characteristics and included a self-assessment. A post-questionnaire collected the students 'appreciations and comments, and included the same self-assessment as well as five additional test questions. This set-up allowed us to not only collect the players' judgements and appreciations about the game, but also to assess achieved learning gains. All student activities were carried out online. As an additional step we have set up a quasi-experiment for exploring to what extent score mechanisms and audio cueing could be used for influencing (reducing) the players' trial-and-error behaviours. The students were randomly distributed over 4 groups each of which was linked to a different version of the game. We implemented two different game score mechanisms and either used short audio cues indicating a correct or incorrect decision, or omitted these. Technically the Playground Game was implemented on the EMERGO platform, which is an open source educational gaming platform developed by the Open University of the Netherlands (www.emergo.cc). The game (so far only a Dutch language version is available) is an outcome of the CHERMUG project (Continuing and Higher Education in Research Methods Using Games), which was sponsored by the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Commission.

AB Game-based approaches can be a motivating and engaging way of teaching and learning, in particular for younger students. To evaluate the suitability of game-based approaches for teaching programming in primary school, we conducted a field study on Computational Thinking (CT). CT can be characterized as the ability to understand, formulate, and systematically solve complex problems, which typically requires abstraction, generalization, parameterization, algorithmization, and partitioning as processes of CT, which are also vital to programming. The employed CT course focused on fostering students' conceptual understanding of computational thinking independent of specific technological applications and was based on course material from code. org. Lessons primarily addressed algorithms as a core CT concept and used game-based learning material to increase students' understanding of algorithmic CT concepts such as sequences, loops, branches, and events. These concepts were first introduced through unplugged game-based activities using tangible everyday objects (e.g. pencils, playing cards, etc.) instead of abstract code. In more advanced lessons, students' conceptual understanding was applied and deepened through plugged-in programming exercises. The 18 sessions (45 minutes each) of the course were taught to 33 3rd and 4th grade primary school students. At the end of unplugged lessons, students' understanding of newly introduced CT concepts was assessed by short tests. Students' interest in and motivation for programming education was measured with pre-and post-course self-assessment questionnaires. Results indicated benefits of the unplugged game-based approach for teaching CT concepts. In particular, we observed (a) for all but one of the CT concepts, students reached on average 82% of the learning objectives or more, and (b) students rated their learning experience in the course positively and reported high levels of interest in learning more about computation-related topics. In addition, qualitative analyses indicated part of the curriculum was very complex for the target group (e.g. nested conditionals). This finding is of particular interest for the development and evaluation of future programming courses for primary school students.

AB This paper presents an assessment of an educational game for teaching the efficient use of electricity. Developed with Adobe Flash (R), it is a virtual board game where participants choose a car that starts the path and reaches the same final goal, going through a number of track steps defined in terms of a dice that each player rolls in turn. The car moves if the participant is able to correctly answer a question that is randomly generated by the software. The objective of the game is to answer questions related to energy efficiency promoting a healthy and attractive learning process for participants on concepts related to energy efficiency such as: the rational use of energy, the basic concepts of forms of energy generation, among others. The main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the application of this virtual game in the teaching and learning process of high school students. Therefore, the game was applied in the discipline of physics in a class of junior high public school in the state of Sao Paulo. Initially, the class that had 43 students was divided into 10 groups of 4 students, and 1 group of 3 students. Each student group competed with one another. The idea was that each of them should indicate a student who was the representative of this group until only 4 group leaders were selected for the finals. At this stage, each student could interact with a group of up to ten students that acted as advisers. The adopted assessment process is based on the model proposed by Savi [7]. Then, at the end of the game, the students answered a prepared questionnaire based on the model proposed by Savi. According to Savi, although there are significant studies that show the importance of educational games for the process of cognitive development and learning concepts of students, there are few papers that present forms of assessing the potential of these resources. Thus, the assessment criteria proposed by Savi are based on the model of training evaluation by Kirkpatrick [3], taken as a reference to measure the efficiency of processes of continuing education courses for professionals. The authors assert that the metric of the evaluation proposed to assess the game is based on the first level of the model proposed by Kirkpatrick.

AB Videogames have long been lauded for their potential to increase engagement and enhance learning when used in classrooms. At the same time, how to best evaluate learning presents challenges, especially when the game does not have standardized assessments built-into it and when games are taken up in a wide variety of ways in quite diverse contexts. This article details the use of a geography game to support learning in 32 diverse classrooms in Ontario, Canada, alongside challenges with evaluating student learning using a game that did not have a built-in assessment system. In total, 795 students participated in the study. Classroom observations and interviews with teachers were triangulated with student pre and post evaluations. Results demonstrated that students did learn from gameplay, as demonstrated through multiple choice and short answer change scores in the pre to post evaluation, despite variations in duration of play and how the game was integrated in the classroom more generally.

AB The so-called game-based learning strategies are based on introducing games in the classrooms to improve aspects such as student performance, concentration and effort. Currently, they provide a very useful resource to increase the motivation of university students, generating a better atmosphere among peers and between student and teacher, which in turn is generally translated into better academic results. However, the design of games that successfully achieve the desired teaching-learning objectives is not a trivial task. This work focuses on the design of games that allow the assessment of ICT-related university subjects. Specifically, four different games are proposed, all based on student participation in teams. After undertaking a preliminary evaluation of the different games, and observing the results obtained in different subjects taught by different teachers, the advantages and disadvantages of each game are discussed. This preliminary study will thus serve as an starting point for a more exhaustive study on the designed games, by including an statistical analysis considering the time variable (results in different academic courses).

AB Recent research has studied game mediated learning and its motivational function. Educational games must maintain their educational function retaining clear definitions of the teaching objectives and instructional methods. This paper evaluated the impact of a game on a reading instructional procedure that has been successfully applied in Brazil. Two matching-to-sample teaching tasks were tested on 19 children in literacy ages. In the condition of standard teaching, only the matching-to-sample tasks were presented. In the game-based condition, the same matching-to-sample tasks were interspaced with game challenges. A behavioral choice procedure indicated the participant's condition choice. After learning 15 words, the participants responded a computerized version of the Learning Motivational Scale of Basic Education, which identified the intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. Results show no motivation and reading scores correlation and validate the choice procedure as reliable predictor of preference.

AB Applying digital games (DG) in medical education and learning is increasing. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the effectiveness of DG compared with other methods in terms of improving knowledge or satisfaction of learners in the medical field. An extensive search of publications dated between 2010 and 2020 was carried out through five databases. The citations as well as extracted data from articles were independently assessed, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible acceding to inclusion. The methodological quality was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment (GRADE). To screen the systematic results, standardized mean difference (SMD) was used, and the pooled effect sizes were calculated by random effects model. I-2 statistics, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were applied to evaluate the heterogeneity. In total 13 RCTs with 1236 subjects were included in research. The systemic analysis indicated a significantly improved effectiveness in support of DG compared to controls in medical education (SMD = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.46-0.69], p < 0.001), without significant publication bias. Additionally, significantly better outcomes were found in the long-retention of knowledge score (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI [0.19-0.55], p < 0.001). However, in the subgroup analysis no significance was indicated in the outcome of overall knowledge after using DG compared with other digital methods (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI [0.46-0.69], p < 0.001). Additionally, six studies assessed the attitude of learners, all of which reported a preference for DG. These results suggest that a DG-based medical curriculum could generate a significant improvement in learning compared to traditional methods.

AB Increasing public awareness is a prerequisite for successful management of invasive alien species (IAS). Environmental education can play an important role in this process by providing relevant learning outcomes and experiences for youth and students, as well as professionals in different sectors associated with introduction pathways or who are involved in mitigation and eradication of IAS. This paper responds to the urgent call for the inclusion of the IAS topic in education through the development, implementation and evaluation of novel and user-friendly educational materials. The aim of this paper is to describe best practices in IAS education and to share the lessons learned from eight educational projects from seven different countries. We discuss four challenges for IAS education, related to (1) inconsistent and ambiguous terminology, (2) communicating risk, (3) implementation of education materials, and (4) evaluation of learning effects. Examples of best practices are the use of smartphone applications and gaming elements, place-based education and exhibitions. We also note the importance of open access publishing of education materials to make them easily available. We intend this discussion to serve as a source of inspiration to researchers, science communicators and teachers and to spur the development of new teaching materials worldwide.

ID COGNITION
AB We define and describe the academic studio model for interdisciplinary, undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes.
   This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.

ID FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT
AB This study aims to determine students' perception of game-based learning platform as a learning evaluation medium. The approach used in this research is descriptive quantitative, and qualitative-the instrument used in the form of a questionnaire containing 22 questions and interviews. The research was conducted in two analytical chemistry classes at a public university in Indonesia. Researchers used Kahoot every two weeks over four months as a tool for formative assessment. Three students from each class were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of Kahoot. Questionnaire data were processed using descriptive statistics, while data from interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings show that chemistry education students' perception of game-based learning platform as a learning evaluation medium is quite good. Students also perceived that Kahoot provided a challenge in learning. Kahoot is also a fun and exciting assessment medium for students. In addition, students feel that their learning motivation has increased in preparing the material to be tested, so direct feedback from Kahoot is very effective in correcting mistakes.

AB Evaluators is an educational tool that lets instructors in computer language implementation courses generate videogames from collections of exercises concerning language processing tasks. For this purpose, the tool adopts attribute grammars as a central model of syntax-directed translation and uses a simple metaphor to map attributed syntax trees and semantic evaluation into videogames. These games provide students with an immersive experience which helps them to better comprehend the fundamental concepts behind attribute grammars. This paper describes Evaluators and reports on its assessment with students in a Compiler Construction course at the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain).

AB The authors use physical concepts to investigate cognitive elaboration using a commercial game-based review teaching method versus a lecture-based method. Experiments involved two popular casual games: Cut the Rope (pendulum concept) and Angry Bird Space (circular motion), with concept maps and multiple-choice tests used as assessment tools. Our goal was to analyze concept reinforcement and reorganization via commercial games for a group of junior high school students. A total of 83 students (15-16 years old), were randomly assigned to an experimental group (review using commercial casual games) or a control group (lecture-based review). Our results suggest that (a) the games supported the elaboration potential of learned physical concepts as measured by concept maps, and (b) concept maps are more suitable than multiple-choice tests for estimating the effects of commercial games on cognitive elaboration. Three key design features of commercial games that can support cognitive elaboration of physical concepts are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MOTIVATION
AB Loss of motivation is one of the most prominent concerns in programming education as it negatively impacts time dedicated to practice, which is crucial for novice programmers. Of the distinct techniques introduced in the literature to engage students, gamification, is likely the most widely explored and fruitful. Game elements that intrinsically motivate students, such as graphical feedback and game-thinking, reveal more reliable long-term positive effects, but those involve significant development effort. This paper proposes a game-based assessment environment for programming challenges, built on top of a specialized framework, in which students develop a program to control the player, henceforth called Software Agent (SA). During the coding phase, students can resort to the graphical feedback demonstrating how the game unfolds to improve their programs and complete the proposed tasks. This environment also promotes competition through competitive evaluation and tournaments among SAs, optionally organized at the end by the teacher. Moreover, the validation of the effectiveness of Asura in increasing undergraduate students' motivation and, consequently, the practice of programming is reported.

AB Instructor-student interaction and regular feedback are seen as teaching strategies designed to support effective learning. These days, there is increasing reliance on technology to support this in the classroom; one such technology is a student response system or its more recent development of this, that is, a game-based one. This study investigates the potential of using game-based student response systems for formative assessment through the analysis of learning outcomes and students' perceptions of the gamified experience in terms of engagement and pleasantness. A quasi-experiment was conducted within an undergraduate course on educational technologies, involving about 400 students. Learning improvements were measured through a pre- and posttest, and students' perceptions were elicited through a questionnaire. Data analysis showed a high level of student satisfaction and an overall improvement of learning outcomes due to the use of game-based student response systems. However, differences in terms of effectiveness were found according to the nature of the topics dealt with in the course, that is, whether or not they were used in the development of theoretical knowledge rather than the use of that knowledge in a more practical context.

ID VALIDITY
AB EBI is a further education establishment which provides education in applied industrial biology at level of MSc engineering degree. Fluid mechanics at EBI was considered by students as difficult who seemed somewhat unmotivated. In order to motivate them, we applied a new play-based pedagogy. Students were asked to draw inspiration from everyday life situations to find applications of fluid mechanics and to do experiments to verify and validate some theoretical results obtained in course. In this paper, we present an innovative teaching/learning pedagogy which includes the concept of learning through play and its implications in fluid mechanics for engineering. Examples of atypical experiments in fluid mechanics made by students are presented. Based on teaching evaluation by students, it is possible to know how students feel the course. The effectiveness of this approach to motivate students is presented through an analysis of students' teaching assessment. Learning through play proved a great success in fluid mechanics where course evaluations increased substantially. Fluid mechanics has been progressively perceived as interesting, useful, pleasant and easy to assimilate. It is shown that this pedagogy which includes educational gaming presents benefits for students. These experiments seem therefore to be a very effective tool for improving teaching/learning activities in higher education.

AB In the past few years a large amount of work has been done in the field of games based learning, mainly with respect to computer based applications. However there have been other, much older and traditional areas of (or related to) games based learning that have also received drastically increased attention from the research community in recent years. The public interest in matters concerning paedagogics has literally exploded, an observation reflected in the coverage by the mainstream media. In previous work the authors have reported on practical hands on studies from the classroom (J. Hildmann) or proposed a formalism designed to represent unambiguous descriptions of observable aspects of learning or (game) playing (H. Hildmann). In this paper aforementioned formal approach is linked to innovative approaches for behavioural evaluation of children and experiential paedagogics, in specific to initiative games. The background of the authors allows the merger of the theoretical contribution from the field of computing with the practical considerations, criticism and requirements of an expert "in the field", i.e. one of those professions that will ultimately be using these new approaches as well as judging and evaluating them.

ID LEARNING ANALYTICS
AB Serious games are highly interactive systems which can therefore capture large amounts of player interaction data. This data can be analyzed to provide a deep insight into the effect of the game on its players. However, traditional techniques to assess players of serious games make little use of interaction data, relying instead on costly external questionnaires. We propose an evidence-based process to improve the assessment of players by using their interaction data. The process first combines player interaction data and traditional questionnaires to derive and refine game learning analytics variables, which can then be used to predict the effects of the game on its players. Once the game is validated, and suitable prediction models have been built, the prediction models can be used in large-scale deployments to assess players solely based on their interactions, without the need for external questionnaires. We briefly describe two case studies where this combination of traditional questionnaires and data mining techniques has been successfully applied. The evidence-based assessment process proposed radically simplifies the deployment and application of serious games in real class settings.

AB Engineering education literature shares a consensual vision of the importance of soft skills for every workplace. Despite of the growing demand for graduates with high EQ (Emotional Intelligence Quotient), one of the main challenges of the industry is the lack of soft skills, in particular, communication and negotiation skills, problem-solving skills, interpersonal skills, as well as critical and creative thinking skills. This paper investigates the enhancement of skills in a game-based learning environment, which was specifically designed to develop both hard (technical) and soft (personal) skills of engineering students through hands on experiences and observations. The acquired data is gathered using data triangulation, and it consists of self-assessments, observations, questionnaires and technical measurements. Preliminary results indicate that the environment has a significant impact on soft skill development, and show a correlation between soft-skill development and the level of motivation and self-evaluation.

AB Serious games have proven to be a powerful tool in education to engage, motivate, and help students learn. However, the change in student knowledge after playing games is usually measured with traditional (paper) prequestionnaires-postquestionnaires. We propose a combination of game learning analytics and data mining techniques to predict knowledge change based on in-game student interactions. We have tested this approach in a case study for which we have conducted preexperiments-postexperiments with 227 students playing a previously validated serious game on first aid techniques. We collected student interaction data while students played, using a game learning analytics infrastructure and the standard data format Experience API for Serious Games. After data collection, we developed and tested prediction models to determine whether knowledge, given as posttest results, can be accurately predicted. Additionally, we compared models both with and without pretest information to determine the importance of previous knowledge when predicting postgame knowledge. The high accuracy of the obtained prediction models suggests that serious games can be used not only to teach but also to measure knowledge acquisition after playing. This will simplify serious games application for educational settings and especially in the classroom easing teachers' evaluation tasks.
