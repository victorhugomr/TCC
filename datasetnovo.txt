AB This research paper focuses on the concept of formative assessment and on the significance that the assessment can have in academic didactics, in order to improve student's performances. As explained by the specialist literature, formative assessment refers to a variety of methods and tools that teacher can use in-process evaluation to understand students' learning needs and requirements with regard to their academic progress. At each level of education and / or vocational training, formative assessment practices help teachers detect notions that are hostile for students' comprehension or to identify learning outcome they have not yet reached. Formative assessment permits teacher to reflect on his / her teaching practices so that corrections can be made to lectures or teaching materials, also imagining academic support and tutoring. Thus, the main objective of formative assessment is to collect precise information or data that can be useful to improve student learning while it is still happening, implementing changes to the planned course of lectures. The relevance of formative assessment in student learning is commonly known: it provides students the basic information for educational choices, for example on the learning method or on the time to spend studying. That being said, this exploratory research presents some result of a pilot study carried out in an academic course to understand the importance of formative assessment across higher education. In this study, teaching method has increased from a teacher-centered approach to blended learning approach, through the introduction of an online test called Kahoot! which take advantages of gamification model. As reported in the information available on the web bases platform, Kahoot! is a free game-based learning, indicative for formative assessment. It has considered to use the classic features of the game (prizes, rewards, competition, entertainment, socialization), which gratify participants motivating them to continue with the learning task, to verify how the information has been retained and learned, in order to improve teaching practice. Reflection on some characteristics of formative assessment could open a new debate on the theory, especially for academic practices. It is understood that there is the necessity for further theoretical improvement in relation to formative assessment, which needs to consider disciplinary specificity, context of application, target, methodologies and tools. Suggestions are made concerning research into formative assessment in higher education and how research can contribute to the improvement of academic didactics, and, consequently, the teaching / learning process.

   discrimination analysis
AB Formative evaluation of instruction, showing that a design can be improved over multiple iterations, is an essential part of instructional design. Much research has already been done on formative assessment of learning in digital games; however, formative assessment of the games themselves is less researched. This paper describes an efficient method to improve the learning outcomes associated with digital learning games over successive game design iterations. The method uses a modified form of item discrimination analysis, a method originating in classical test theory (Novick, 1966), combined with in-game data tracking. For the three examples provided here, data collected from a controlled, randomized trial was used to correlate player behavior with pre-and post-test scores. This data was then used to revise the games. This can be customized for use in the formative evaluation of a variety of learning games across multiple subjects.

AB BackgroundGamification is an increasingly common phenomenon in education. It is a technique to facilitate formative assessment and to promote student learning. It has been shown to be more effective than traditional methods. This phenomenological study was conducted to explore the advantages of gamification through the use of the Kahoot! platform for formative assessment in medical education.MethodsThis study employed a phenomenological design. Five focus groups were conducted with medical students who had participated in several Kahoot! sessions.ResultsThirty-six categories and nine sub-themes emerged from the focus group discussions. They were grouped into three themes: attractive learning tool, learning guidance and source of motivation.ConclusionsThe results suggest that Kahoot! sessions motivate students to study, to determine the subject matter that needs to be studied and to be aware of what they have learned. Thus, the platform is a promising tool for formative assessment in medical education.

AB This research aims to develop a multiple-choice Web-based quiz-game-like formative assessment system, named GAM-WATA. The unique design of 'Ask-Hint Strategy' turns the Web-based formative assessment into an online quiz game. 'Ask-Hint Strategy' is composed of 'Prune Strategy' and 'Call-in Strategy'. 'Prune Strategy' removes one incorrect option and turns the original 4-option item into a 3-option one. 'Call-in Strategy' provides the rate at which other test takers choose each option when answering a question. This research also compares the effectiveness of three different types of formative assessment in an e-Learning environment: paper-and-pencil test (PPT), normal Web-based test (N-WBT) and GAM-WATA. In total, 165 fifth grade elementary students (from six classes) in central Taiwan participated in this research. The six classes of students were then divided into three groups and each group was randomly assigned one type of formative assessment. Overall results indicate that different types of formative assessment have significant impacts on e-Learning effectiveness and that the e-Learning effectiveness of the students in the GAM-WATA group appears to be better. Students in the GAM-WATA group more actively participate in Web-based formative assessment to do self-assessment than students in the N-WBT group. The effectiveness of formative assessment will not be significantly improved only by replacing the paper-and-pencil test with Web-based test. The strategies included in GAM-WATA are recommended to be taken into consideration when researchers design Web-based formative assessment systems in the future. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the differences in learners' performance and perceived engagement between three intervention groups in a Science class, using two types of pedagogical intervention: traditional instruction with paper-based quizzes and gamified instruction with gamified e-quizzes as formative assessments. With respect to the gamified instruction, three types of gamification applications were employed: Socrative, Quizizz, and iSpring Learn LMS. The effects of the instructional intervention (n = 94), as well as evaluative feedback, were obtained with the aid of formative quizzes, post-questionnaire surveys, and personal interviews. The results showed that the employment of innovative gamified e-quiz applications (i.e., Socrative, Quizizz, and iSpring Learn LMS) and paper-based quizzes were effective in evaluating students' learning performance, particularly as formative assessment after completing each topic. Finding ways to apply games or game concepts in the classroom can be a promising and innovative tool for educators to engage their students in creative learning skills and attractive competition.

AB Formative assessment is able to promote learning and this could be fully used in educational game to produce better game-based learning. However what kind of feedback is effective in an information literacy educational game, and how formative assessments should be carried out, these problems need specific study. In the information literacy educational game Wisdom Town, a series of formative assessment are arranged to inspect game-based learning effects, at the same time, to drive the development of story and learning. It turns out that immediate feedback in this game is very helpful for students to learn knowledge about full-text journal databases. It is confirmed that formative assessment is able to promote learning in information literacy educational game, and multiple immediate feedback provides students opportunities to understand and apply knowledge.

AB This paper presents the comparison study of different multiple-choice web-based formative assessment; namely peer driven assessment module of the web-based assessment and test analysis system (PDA-WATA), one of the most recent web-based assessment system, web-based quiz-game-like formative assessment system, named GAM-WATA, and Formative Assessment Module of WATA system FAM-WATA with traditionaly normal web-based assessment and paper and pencil assessment. The major purpose of this study is to highlight the different strategies used in these system and effectiveness of each system in e-learning environment. In overall, the features and different strategies of systems is analyzed. It is found that PDA-WATA adopts more self-regulated learning strategies than the other systems in facilitating learners use of self-regulatory learning behavoir in e-learning environment. More studies are required based on different self regulatory strategies used to improving learning effectivness, attracting learners take participation of web-based formative assessment.

   OUTCOMES
AB Providing formative assessment opportunities has been recognised as a significant benefit to student learning. The outcome of any formative assessment should be one that ultimately helps improve student learning through familiarising students with the levels of learning required, informing them about gaps in their learning and providing feedback to guide the direction of learning. This article provides an example of how formative assessments can be developed into a formative assessment journey where a number of different assessments can be offered to students during the course of a module of teaching, thus utilising a spaced-education approach. As well as incorporating the specific drivers of formative assessment, we demonstrate how approaches deemed to be stimulating, interactive and entertaining with the aim of maximising enthusiasm and engagement can be incorporated. We provide an example of a mixed approach to evaluating elements of the assessment journey that focuses student reaction, appraisal of qualitative and quantitative feedback from student questionnaires, focus group analysis and teacher observations. Whilst it is not possible to determine a quantifiable effect of the assessment journey on student learning, usage data and student feedback shows that formative assessment can achieve high engagement and positive response to different assessments. Those assessments incorporating an active learning element and a quiz-based approach appear to be particularly popular. A spaced-education format encourages a building block approach to learning that is continuous in nature rather than focussed on an intense period of study prior to summative examinations.

DT Article
ID EDUCATION; GAMES
AB Background: Formative assessments are tools for assessing content retention, providing valuable feedback to students and teachers. In medical education, information technology-supported games can accommodate large classes divided into student teams while fostering active engagement.
   Aim: To establish an innovative stimulating approach to formative assessments for large classes furthering collaborative skills that promotes learning and student engagement linked to improvement of academic performance.
   Methods and results: Using audience response technology, a fast-paced, competitive, interactive quiz game involving dermatology was developed. This stimulating setting, provided on the last day of class, prepares students for high-stakes exams to continue their medical education while training collaborative skills as supported by survey outcomes and average class scores.
   Summary and conclusions: Educational game competitions provide formative assessments and feedback for students and faculty alike, enhancing learning and teaching processes. In this study, we show an innovative approach to accommodate a large class divided into competing teams furthering collaborative skills reflected by academic performance.

   Assessment in Instructional Video Games for Undergraduate Biology

AB This study examined the role of formative and summative assessment in instructional video games on student learning and engagement. A 2 (formative feedback: present vs absent) x 2 (summative feedback: present vs absent) factorial design with an offset control (recorded lecture) was conducted to explore the impacts of assessment in video games. A total of 172 undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of four instructional video game conditions or the control. Results found that knowledge significantly increased from the pretest for players in all game conditions. Participants in summative assessment conditions learned more than players without summative assessment. In terms of engagement outcomes, formative assessment conditions did not significantly produce better learning engagement outcomes than conditions without formative assessment. However, summative assessment conditions were associated with higher temporal disassociation than non-summative conditions. Implications for future instructional video game development and testing are discussed in the paper.

AB In a physics classroom, kinematics is an essential concept that must be mastered before learning others. The students need ongoing practice and assistance in understanding it. Formative assessment is one of the alternatives to help students reshape their conceptual understanding, but its implementation is often constrained. The implementation of isomorphic multiple choice items as part of computer games is expected to help them overcome the problems. Physics Formative Feedback Game (PF2G) has been developed by utilizing isomorphic multiple choice items. Based on the results of the initial trial, PF2G got a good response, from the physics teacher and also from the students.

AB The use of computer games in education has been increasing in popularity during the past decade. Game-based learning environments are designed to teach specific knowledge content and skill-based learning outcomes using game elements. One main reason for using game-based learning environments is to increase student motivation and engagement while teaching learning outcomes. Many of the game-based learning environments are designed so that students will reach maximum flow, which is defined as students being so completely immersed in that game that they do not notice that they are learning. These learning environments have been shown to improve many behaviour and cognitive learning outcomes. While game-based learning has many benefits, some educational researchers have indicated that it is often very costly to develop a complex game-based assessment to teach a few learning outcomes. Hence, in some cases it is more beneficial to approach the use of computer games in education using gamification.

AB The goal of this research is to implement a prototype online game learning management platform with high usability via a formative design approach. Two stages of usability evaluations, namely, cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation, are applied to assess the prototype system, followed by a small-scale survey. A total of 15 suggestions are obtained; In general, the students adequately perceived the incremental functionalities on real estate transactions and the learning concepts intended by this research. As a learning game, its design earned recognitions and raised user intention to use this platform as a learning tool. The overall user satisfaction on both the game and the class management platform ranges from neutral to slightly positive, thereby implying a positive general user attitude with more expectations for improvements. With this initial formative evaluation, the outcomes provide valuable input to subsequent formative design stages, as well as a foundation for high usability, closer to actual game scenarios, and a pioneering platform for informal game learning in higher education applications.

ID GAMIFICATION
AB In this paper we present a newly developed online learning platform which introduces gamification elements into software engineering education. Starting from assumptions based on cognitive load theory we present the design of an online gamification-based training system to be used in software engineering contexts. Students can voluntarily solve challenges for which they may earn credits. These small problems serve as assessments; the approach follows the assessment for learning paradigm in that assessments provide formative feedback to enhance the learning experience. The combination of formative assessment and gamification is new to software engineering education. We describe system design as well as the different types of challenges in detail. We also provide several examples for actual challenges used in an object-oriented programming introduction using Java.

DE formative feedback; web resources; assessment
AB Well-designed formative feedback can enhance both instructor teaching and student learning with "two-way" feedback. The project goal was to use web-enabled tools and resources that facilitate the strategies, practices, and assessments that use frequent formative feedback to improve student attitude, learning, and achievement. The research question is, "What is the effect of formative feedback, engagement pedagogy, and web-enabled resources on student outcomes across diverse settings?" The web tools included: a two-way student-reflection and instructor-feedback web data collection tool; a web vocabulary building tool with e-flash cards and e-vocabulary games; and a slide sharing site that has the slide sets from each tutorial video. Assessment was done for student: resource use with Student Resource Value Survey (SRVS); attitude and impact with a Student Impact Value Survey (SIVS); achievement with a Materials Concept Inventory (MCI); and persistence with a week-2 to week-15 head count. Results showed: large changes in certain resources from SRVS; very positive values of motivation and utility from SIVS; a 36% moderate Hake gain from the MCI; and 97% persistence. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the principles and tools of a web and engagement curricular enhancement model can have good outcomes with the potential for implementation in other disciplines.

AB Augmented reality (AR) is helpful in leading students to observe real-world learning targets with supports from online learning resources using mobile and wireless communication technologies. In this study, an AR-based learning system for an architecture course is proposed based on a formative assessment mechanism, which guides students to find answers on their own by giving hints when they fail to correctly answer questions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment has been conducted in the Museum of World Religions for a university architecture course. A total of 39 students were randomly assigned to an experimental group learning with the proposed approach and a control group learning with the conventional AR-based learning. The experimental results showed that the AR-based learning with the formative assessment mechanism significantly improved the students' learning achievements and motivation, while also reducing their cognitive load.

SO RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION

DT Review
DE Education technology; formative assessment; systematic review
AB While education technology has been widely used in classrooms, and considerable investments have been made to support its use in the UK, the evidence base for many such rapidly changing technologies is weak, and their efficacy is unclear. The aim of this paper is to systematically review and synthesise empirical research on the use of technology in formative assessment, to identify approaches that are effective in improving pupils' learning outcomes. The review involved a search of 11 major databases, and included 55 eligible studies. The results suggest promising evidence that digitally delivered formative assessment could facilitate the learning of maths and reading for young children, but there is no good evidence that it is effective for other subjects, or for older children, or that it is any more effective than formative assessment without technology. The review found no good evidence that learner response systems work in enhancing children's academic attainment, and there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of such technologies that embed gaming features. Much research in this area is of poor quality. More rigorous studies using causal designs are thus urgently needed. Meantime, there should be no rush to use technology on the basis of improving attainment.

AB Making activities and environments have been shown to foster the development of computational thinking (CT) skills for students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subject areas. To properly cultivate CT skills and the related dispositions, educators must understand students' needs and build awareness of how CT informs a deeper understanding of the academic content area. "Assessing Computational Thinking in Maker Activities" (ACTMA) is a design-based research study that developed a curricular unit around physics, making, and CT. The project in this paper studied how instructors could use formative assessment to uncover students' prior knowledge and improve their use of CT. This study aims to provide a qualitative analysis of one lesson in the unit implementation of an informal makerspace environment that strived to be culturally responsive. The study examined "moments of notice," or instances where formative assessment could guide students' understanding of CT. We found elements in the establishment of a classroom culture that can generate a continual use of informal formative assessment between instructors and students. This culture includes using materials in conjunction with the promotion of CT concepts and dispositions, focusing on drawing for understanding, the practice of debugging, and fluidity of roles in the learning space.

AB The main aim of this study is to analyze the influence of an educational innovation based on formative assessment, on the motivation of university students towards a subject of the Degree in Primary Education. To this end, 91 students from University of Seville participated in a teaching innovation project during the 2018-2019 academic year, where a general process of formative assessment as well as other didactic and technological resources were applied, such as use of gamification and interactive response commands, among others. At the end of the intervention students answered the Spanish version of Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (CEAM II) in order to analyze, among other variables, students' motivation. The findings show high levels of motivation, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Therefore, the data obtained suggest this experience can be considered as a good educational practice and they encourage us to continue working in this line.

AB This study proposed an online learning system for energy education, modifying the typical rules of tictac-toe and incorporating multiple choice tests into the game in order to develop a game-based formative assessment tool for an online learning course. In order to explore how different gaming modes and feedback types in this game-based formative assessment affect knowledge acquisition effectiveness and participation perceptions, a tic-tac-toe quiz game (TRIS-Q) with two gaming modes: single-player online game (SOG) and multi-player online game (MOG), and two feedback types: immediate elaborated feedback (IEF) and no immediate elaborated feedback (no IEF), were developed. A 2(SOG vs. MOG) x 2(IEF vs. no IEF) between-subject experiment was also conducted to investigate the effects on 109 ninth-grade students from four junior high school classes. The research findings indicated that different gaming modes of TRIS-Q did not affect the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition; providing IEF for each question answered in the game facilitated the enhancement of both energy knowledge acquisition and student tic-tac-toe ability when comparing it with the no IEF type. Additionally, the different gaming modes and feedback types did not affect participation perceptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This investigation was conducted to examine middle school students' use of formative assessment technologies in informal science learning contexts. Specifically, this study focused on students' overall preferences when using a game-based student response system (GSRS; Wang, 2015) as a formative assessment. Data sources included students' (n = 42) self-reported preferences for competitive versus non-competitive GSRS, teachers' reflective journals, and external observations focused on student engagement. Data analysis examined the degree to which students preferred competitive or noncompetitive types of games. The study also uncovered some of the challenges associated with implementation. Results illuminate potential trade-offs and suggest that while students ultimately prefer competitive-style games, the competitive nature of those games sometimes proved to be a hindrance with undesirable characteristics. More research is needed to better understand this discrepancy, and to better determine how the competitive characteristics might influence students' perceptions of the tools.

   role-playing games (MMORPGs); Motivation
AB In the first decade of the 21st century, distance learning (usually subject to course fees and resulting in formal certification) was complemented by free-of-charge open learning courses with unlimited numbers of participants and no final certificate. Termed massive open online courses (MOOCs), these soon fell into different categories, depending on their concept. Among them are connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs) which emphasise a collaborative approach to learning. However, while initial enrolment is indeed massive, completion rates are very low and cMOOCs notoriously lack an appropriate method of evaluating learning progress and motivational resources. The author of this article suggests that one way of addressing this problem might be to adapt motivational formative assessment tools used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to cMOOCs. He argues that some characteristics of MMORPGs can be effectively incorporated in cMOOCs, thus benefiting from the motivational potential of MMORPGs. He cautions, however, that even if MMORPGs (and ongoing, low-stakes formative assessment in general) are motivational, they can only be applied to cMOOCs if the idea of formative assessment is not in tension with connectivist principles. Hence, the author argues for their compatibility, and builds on peer-to-peer assessment as a solution for resource allocation problems with low instructor-learner ratio.

AB In this paper we present a software platform called Chatbot designed to introduce high school students to Computer Science (CS) concepts in an innovative way: by programming chatbots. A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish. While programming their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others. Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students. When an error is found, the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level. We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies. An online nation-wide competition where more than 10,000 students participated. And, a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools. We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported interest, etc.) and found that girls' engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys' for most indicators. Also, in the online competition, the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice. Our results suggest that the availability of automatic formative assessment may have an impact on task completion and other engagement indicators among high school students.

AB This study used innovative assessment practices to obtain and document broad learning outcomes for a 15-hour game-based curriculum in Quest Atlantis, a multi-user virtual environment that supports school-based participation in socio scientific inquiry in ecological sciences. Design-based methods were used to refine and align the enactment of virtual narrative and scientific investigations to a challenging problem solving assessment and indirectly to achievement test items that were independent of the curriculum. In study one, one-sixth grade teacher used the curriculum in two of his classes and obtained larger gains in understanding and achievement than his two other classes, which used an expository text to learn the same concepts and skills. Further treatment refinements were carried out, and two forms of virtual formative feedback were introduced. In study two, the same teacher used the curriculum in all four of his classes; the revised curriculum resulted in even larger gains in understanding and achievement. Gains averaged 1.1 SD and 0.4 SD, respectively, with greater gains shown for students who engaged more with formative feedback. Principles for assessing designs and designing assessments in virtual environments are presented.

AB Nowadays, intelligent tutoring systems are considered an effective research tool for learning systems and problem-solving skill improvement. Nonetheless, such individualized systems may cause students to lose learning motivation when interaction and timely guidance are lacking. In order to address this problem, a solution-based intelligent tutoring system (SITS) is integrated with an online game-based formative assessment game called tic-tac-toe quiz for single-player (TRIS-Q-SP) for learning computer programming. This assessment game combines tic-tac-toe with online assessment, and the rules of tic-tac-toe are revised to stimulate students to use online formative assessment actively. Finally, an experimental study is devised to assess the success of SITS, and significant achievements are observed for the experimental group, besides enjoyment and positive opinions toward the TRIS-Q-SP. Therefore, the practical use of SITS is supported, as the results indicate considerable advantages for the experimental group over the control group. The findings also reveal that immediate elaborated feedback upon answering each question in TRIS-Q-SP is part of an optimal design.

AB The main purpose of this study was to determine if the use of formative assessment had an impact on learning outcomes of grade four students, in science subject. In Pakistan, summative assessment is in common practice that evaluates the student learning at the end of a unit or course. Recent summative assessment done by National Education Assessment System (NEAS) for primary education in science subject reveals an overall poor performance with only 21% students crossing the mean score. The most alarming aspect of report is that 98% of the teachers reported students' difficulty in lesson during instructions, which raises serious questions regarding the education process that is failing to develop the needed understanding.
   In this study the research was conducted using an interactive science quiz application, developed in accordance with the latest Pakistan National Curriculum for General Science. The quiz application is based on the first unit of science textbook named "understanding ourselves". It consists of 16 questions covering human body organs. The purpose of developing this formative assessment quiz application was to move students' learning forward by providing timely feedback in the form of additional information and to engage them with the content by adding game elements. The game elements used in this quiz application are story, characters, sounds, feedback, rewards and scores.
   This research was carried out on fourth grade students in two federal government schools, for boys and girls, respectively. The schools are located in Islamabad. An experimental research design was utilized to gather quantitative data through the use of pre and post-test. The pre and post-test were validated with the support of science teachers. Participants (N=120) were divided into two groups: control and experiment group. The students (N=60) in experimental group used a formative assessment interactive science quiz application for a week. The pre-test and post-test scores of control and experiment group were compared to determine if the use of formative assessment had a statistically significant impact on students' performance. In order to compare the scores within control group the pre-test/post-test scores of control group were compared. While the pre-test/post-test scores of experiment group were compared to determine the effectiveness of formative assessment interactive quiz application. Moreover, to determine the impact of quiz application on gender differences in scores, pre and post-test of the experimental group were compared.
   Results of this study reveal that the students (N=60), including boys and girls, in the control group did not show a significant change in scores. Their scores before and after the intervention remained same or decreased. The results from the experimental group (N=60), including boys and girls showed a statistically significant increase in scores after using the formative science quiz application. This exhibits that descriptive feedback and game elements enhanced student outcome and developed their understanding. Students were found to be more engaged and attentive during the learning process. Additional research to determine the effectiveness of formative assessment at primary level, by making interactive quizzes for all the units of science textbook can make this research more valuable.

AB This paper presents the results of a research work carried out in order to develop a novel gaming model for formative knowledge assessment (FKA). The benefits of FKA are well acknowledged by educators as it aids for better learning. As FKA is more frequent, the students' willingness to take frequent assessments is poor. Often the students expressed that they felt uncomfortable and this resulted in lack of active participation. These are considered as major challenges to be addressed. Hence, this research aimed to find a way to make the assessments interesting. Based on the positive responses for game-based learning, a theoretical model that integrates the principles of extensive games (EGs) and concept map (CM), namely concept tree game (CTG), has been defined and developed. Further, a qualitative research has been performed to evaluate the impact of the FKA model. Major data gathering techniques used in this work were a class test, proposed FKA method, participant observation, survey and focussed team interview. The data were analysed statistically and the results revealed that it has been effective and useful for educators in assessing the knowledge of students and for students, it aided them to know where they stand and helped them to learn effectively.

AB The use of game-based learning in the classroom has become more common in recent years. Many game-based learning tools and platforms are based on a quiz concept where the students can score points if they can choose the correct answer among multiple answers. The article describes an experiment where the game-based student response system Kahoot! was compared to a traditional non-gamified student response system, as well as the usage of paper forms for formative assessment. The goal of the experiment was to investigate whether gamified formative assessments improve the students' engagement, motivation, enjoyment, concentration, and learning. In the experiment, the three different formative assessment tools/methods were used to review and summarize the same topic in three parallel lectures in an IT introductory course. The first method was to have the students complete a paper quiz, and then review the results afterwards using hand raising. The second method was to use the non-gamified student response system Clicker where the students gave their response to a quiz through polling. The third method was to use the game-based student response system Kahoot!. All three lectures were taught in the exact same way, teaching the same syllabus and using the same teacher. The only differences were the lecture hall and the method use to summarize the lecture. A total of 384 students participated in the experiment, where 127 subjects did the paper quiz, 175 used the non-gamified student response system, and 82 students using the gamified approach. The gender distribution was 48% female students and 52% male students. Pre- and a post-test were used to assess the learning outcome of the lectures, and a questionnaire was used to get data on the students' engagement and motivation. The results show significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach, but we did not find significant learning improvement.

AB An understanding of the hormonal basis of normal growth and development, including the changes occurring at puberty, is important foundation knowledge for contemporary medical practice in most fields of medicine. A quiz, testing the important physiological concepts of growth and puberty, was designed using the format of the well-known television game "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." An evaluation of this formative assessment activity revealed that a cohort of first-year undergraduate medical students valued learning with peers in an enjoyable, interactive environment, where they were able to admit to uncertainties and clarify answers. It also showed that making an educational activity fun need not detract from the focus of giving feedback on learning. Formative assessment, known to produce learning gains in a range of educational settings, is an important activity in contemporary medical education. With a greater emphasis on self-directed learning and less well-defined curriculum boundaries, feedback helps students to understand and apply the important physiological concepts that underpin the practice of medicine.

AB The attention on the use of computer games in education (educational gaming) is quickly growing. By investigating the impact of video games in school, researchers have shown a remarkable improvement in student engagement and motivation. Nevertheless, the effects of educational gaming have rarely been considered on a long running application and, most important, they have never been considered in the whole teaching process as a means for teachers to real-time monitor students' learning. In this paper, we investigate the use of video games associated with formative assessment to pursue the above objective. In particular, we have conceived and implemented a portal, named PlayLearn, aimed at administering online tests based on multiple-choice quizzes, by means of video games. By letting the students play, the portal helps students to learn, it evaluates them and, finally stores their learning parameters which can be used by the teachers to improve in real-time the learning process, all in a virtuous circle.

AB In this study, 154 students individually played a challenging physics video game for roughly 4 h. Based on time data for both solved and unsolved problems derived from log files, we created a game-based assessment of persistence that was validated against an existing measure of persistence. We found that the game-based assessment of persistence predicted learning of qualitative physics after controlling for gender, video game experience, pretest knowledge and enjoyment of the game. These findings support the implementation of a real-time formative assessment of persistence to be used to dynamically change gameplay. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose This study aims to present research evidence on the relevance of online gamification flip learning as a pedagogical instruction in promoting learning engagement when college students are impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. In this study, a gamified formative assessment was used to examine learner engagement and to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification within a synchronous online flipped instruction. Design/methodology/approach A multiphase mixed methods research design was used for this study. The evaluation relied on triangulated evidence gathered through questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews administered at an Indonesian college setting. Findings Based on the findings, gamified learning and formative assessments that adopt online flipped approaches have shown a positive bearing on learner engagement, despite the challenges learners face while harrowing through times of calamity. The results of this study provide prima facie support for the claim that the use of interactive gamified e-quizzes proves to be an innovative means of stimulating student engagement during the online class. Originality/value The results further suggest that a learning framework that incorporates both online flipped and gamification techniques provide the stimulus that is likely to forge an emotional connection that can inspire learner engagement, much needed when learners rally through calamitous events. This study has established evidential links between gamification and flipped classroom instructional delivery, particularly for online class settings. It is well-anticipated that gamification flip learning can continue to be implemented either in online, blended or face-to-face class instruction and particularly after the time of the pandemic.

AB The revolution of this current digital era has led to changes in the way how teaching is done. An example is that game-based tech tools have been widely integrated in English as Foreign Language (EFL) formative assessment processes carried out in the classrooms. As this technology is introduced rapidly is crucial to evaluate if it brings real benefits to education. For that, the main aim of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of the use of Quizizz online learning application in enhancing students' performance by comparing it to the traditional pen-to-paper exercises in grammar and vocabulary lessons. In this work, two groups of Ecuadorian students majoring software engineering enrolled in Module 2 of the English Language Program in 2019 at one Ecuadorian university were selected. A Pre-experimental design was employed in which one class participated as control group and the other as experimental group. In the last stage of the lessons, participants in the control group were asked to complete exercises in the book or in worksheets; on the other hand, students in the experimental group were required to join to Quizizz live games monitored by the teacher and from which they obtained immediate feedback after each question. After the treatment period, tests were taken by both groups. The results show score differences between students who worked with Quizizz in their learning process and their counterparts. The independent t-test at the 0.05 level of significance was utilized to determine if the differences found are statistically significant. As using gamified assessment tools in EFL instruction constitutes a growing area of research, some possible influencing factors for these findings are discussed in this paper.

ID FEEDBACK
AB Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been producing consistent learning gains for decades. However, a common problem with these systems is maintaining student engagement without reducing the learning benefits. In order to balance the learning benefits of ITSs with the motivational benefits of games, an online formative assessment game called tic-tac-toe quiz for single-player (TRIS-Q-SP) is incorporated in a Flowchart-based Intelligent Tutoring System (FITS), benefiting from Bayesian networks for the process of decision making, for learning computer programming. This assessment game combines tic-tac-toe with online assessment, and revises the rule of tic-tac-toe for stimulating students to use online formative assessment actively. Finally, an empirical investigation carried out to evaluate the performance of FITS indicating that considerable gains for the experimental group over the control group. The proposed system extensively enhanced students' learning interest, attitude and degree of technology acceptance, as well as improved their achievements in problem solving activities. Additionally, the findings also reveal that providing Immediate Elaborated Feedback (IEF) for each answered question in TRIS-Q-SP is the optimal design, as it facilitated the enhancement of programming knowledge acquisition when comparing it with the No Immediate Elaborated Feedback (NIEF) condition.

AB Different e-learning technologies may offer different incentive factors, which influence behavioural intention. Moreover, when adopting a new e-learning technology for an extended period, learners' perceptions and learning behaviour may change during the learning period. Unfortunately, as formative assessments (FAs) are often continuously performed during a semester, few studies have investigated how the two FA tools: computer-based assessment (CBA) and game-based assessment (GBA), influence learning perception, behavioural intention, and learning achievement during the learning period under the possible existence of the above phenomena. This study used a quasi-experiment design in which one class used CBA as an FA tool and the other used GBA (i.e. Kahoot!) in a university level course for one semester. This study makes the following findings. First, the incentive factors influencing behavioural intention for CBA and for GBA (Kahoot!) differ in the early stage (before the mid-term). Second, the incentive factors influencing behavioural intention fluctuated in both classes over the one-semester experiment. Third, although the CBA class had significantly higher scores than the Kahoot! class for every FA, there was no significant difference between the mid-term and the final term scores (learning achievement) of the two classes.

AB Information and communication technology has produced changes in the demands of modern-day society (e.g., most jobs will require advanced digital skills in the short term). In addition, nowadays, new active methodologies using emerging technologies are being put into practice. However, little research has been conducted with pre-service teachers, particularly in the teaching of history. This quantitative study analysed the impact of the implementation of a mixed methodology using inquiry-based learning and a student response system (SRS) for the formative assessment of the academic achievement of 240 prospective primary teachers of history. The application of this mixed methodology shows better academic results than traditional lecture-based teaching. In addition, students' scores achieved through use of the SRS predicted the scores of male students in the final exam; however, this was not in the case for females.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   The introduction of information and communication technology into history teaching brings active learning environments in higher education.
   Pre-service teachers can improve their knowledge of history through the implementation of inquiry-based learning methodology and SRSs.
   Our results indicate that an SRS can be an effective tool for teachers to carry out students' formative assessment.
   Teachers can effectively use SRS scores to predict male students' performance in history, but not female performance.

AB The popularity of interactive whiteboards (IWBs) has grown and, in many countries, are nearly ubiquitous. Nevertheless, a lack of training, among other factors, has led to teachers misusing, or even abandoning this technology. While IWBs should improve learning outcomes, few studies have evaluated the impact of long-term IWB-based instruction. The purpose of this study is to track changes in the mathematical performance through formative assessment (FA) for primary school students participating in an IWB Formative Assessment (FA) system, characterized by elements including feedback, social learning through discussions, agentive learning through personalized options, and game-based learning featuring among-group competition and within-group collaboration. A convenience sample of 178 s-grade students from the same grade (four classes) participated in the study, which lasted one school year. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was utilized to analyze data from the IWB system, revealing the following: (1) a significant correlation between students' involvement in formative IWB activities and mathematics achievement (t = 6.52; p = 0.00); (2) no effect of gender on initial mathematics performance; (3) a significant role of student motivational goals on initial mathematics performance, with higher mastery-avoidance associated with better initial assessments (t = 2.02, p = 0.04) and higher performance-avoidance associated with lower initial assessments (t = -2.60, p = 0.03); (4) interaction between gender and linear change, with girls outperforming boys (t = -2.57, p = 0.01) in FA performance over time (although boys made advances on summative assessments); and (5) a negative interaction of mastery-avoidance with linear change, where higher levels of mastery-avoidance were associated with a greater decline in FA performance over time (t = -2.57, p = 0.01). In short, the research findings suggest that if teachers use IWB-based FA over a relatively long time, they must pay special attention to boys and those who hold high mastery-avoidance goals.

AB The new generation students have never identified the life without internet, computers, tablets and smart phones. Their routine lives are consumed by the usage of electronic media for everything from entertainment to communication as well as learning process. Playing interactive games, hearing music are most commonly preferred by current generation students. Most of the students are showing interest on playing games. Typical to their life style, students are increasingly seeking more interesting and engaging class room environment rather than boring traditional class room teaching. The students like to work in groups and they believe that education should be engaging and interactive. Convincing students to study material is regularly frustrating and challenging task for the teachers. It is increasingly evident that lack of concentration stimulates lack of interest as class progresses which is why students tend to stare at the clock. To overcome these problems class room materials is integrated with attractive games to foster collaborative learning. Integrating interactive educational games to the lesson planning is challenging task for every teacher. Jeopardy is America's most favorite television Quiz game show, which can be simply modified as "Interactive Review Game" and "Real-time Quiz activity" in Moodle that can be incorporated as a review activity into any subject area in higher education. This paper explains the usage and evaluation of the interactive review tools for self-assessment and formative assessment for graduate level engineering students in Oman.

AB The development of the so-called 21st century skills is currently mentioned as one of the key objectives that education systems must achieve throughout the world, so that citizens as a whole can adapt adequately to the labor market and in general, to the future society. The purpose of this review is, given the explosive and growing interest in this topic, to identify the various definitions of the skills of the 21st century and then to recognize the relationships that can be found between these skills and STEAM learning environments, which recently have been proposed as suitable scenarios for developing them. The study was developed as a systematic literature review based on abstracting and in-depth reading of 153 scientific articles published in journals indexed in Scopus and Scielo. The results of the study suggest that, in order to guide the development of 21st century skills, it is convenient to consider when designing STEAM learning environments, issues such as the change in the assessment towards a more formative experience, the inclusion of collaborative and social environments, the use of research-based learning strategies and gamification and games, among others.

AB The research explores the potential of online gamified resources used as means of formative assessment during foreign language lessons in higher education institutions. The use of any game-based tools with certain game elements which can be integrated into conventional or online teaching and learning is considered to be characteristic of game-based approach to teaching and learning. The study established the main elements of educational gamified tools. These elements of game mechanics are capable of triggering such senses and emotions as reward, challenge, achievement, competition and positive emotions. A number of theoretical and empirical research methods have been applied to analyse and prove the benefits of digital interactive tools as effective means of formative assessment of students' progress in mastering a foreign language and an invaluable source for constructive feedback for the development of students' foreign language competence. Three online game-based learning platforms, Kahoot!, Wordwall and Mentimeter, have been selected for analysis. Being compatible with popular video conferencing solutions, these tools proved to be easy to master and suitable for the tasks and purposes of foreign language lessons. The author maintains that activities devised with the help of Wordwall, Kahoot! and Mentimeter can be employed at foreign language lessons to practise vocabulary and grammar, to consolidate the material and reinforce learning, to assess the knowledge of the syllabus vocabulary and grammar, to check comprehension of texts, to revise for tests. The analysis of game mechanics proves that online game-based tools facilitate mastering knowledge and skills by means of influencing students' motivational sphere through creating enjoyable learning environment and providing prompt feedback. Another major advantage of digital gamified resources is supplying the educator with a variety of instruction tools and assessment techniques to meet individual student needs. Detailed reports on student performance in activities available in the toolbar of these platforms offer useful data for analysis and creating an effective teacher feedback aimed at developing students' foreign language competence.

AB Introduction: Pathology learning for medical undergraduate students is a challenging task. Kahoot! is a mobile game-based online digital formative assessment tool that can engage students in its learning. This study is the first to assess the effect of Kahoot! use on Pathology learning outside classroom using a comparative group with assessment done at the end of the course. Methods: The study was carried out on the first-year Pathology students at Helwan University, Faculty of Medicine, after ending a basic Pathology course. The study is a retrospective quasi-experimental quantitative study. Academic performance of students in Pathology was compared between Kahoot! and non-Kahoot! users (55 students each). In addition, an online survey was introduced to the 55 Kahoot! user students to investigate their perceptions on it. Survey and test score data were analyzed by appropriate tests using IBM-SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). The level of significance was P Results: Kahoot! enhanced Pathology understanding (83.6%), retaining knowledge (87.3%), made learning fun and motivating (89.1%). Other mentioned advantages of Kahoot! were practicing for exam (40%), simple and easy to use (36.4%), competitive (18.2%), self confidence booster (10.9%), forming a comprehensive image of the lecture (9%), quick (9%), and imagining skills booster (5.5%). Mentioned disadvantages included no explanation for the answers to questions (20%). A quarter of the students stated that the time limit for the questions was short (27.3%). Kahoot! use was significantly associated with better Pathology academic performance (P = 0.001), and it was not related to the general academic performance of the students (P = 0.06). Most users (85.4%) recommended its continuous future use. Conclusions: The study offers an endorsement to the use of Kahoot! for gamifying formative assessment of Pathology and can provide a basis for the design of an online Kahoot! -based continuous formative assessment plans implemented outside-classroom in the Pathology curricula.

AB Instructor-student interaction and regular feedback are seen as teaching strategies designed to support effective learning. These days, there is increasing reliance on technology to support this in the classroom; one such technology is a student response system or its more recent development of this, that is, a game-based one. This study investigates the potential of using game-based student response systems for formative assessment through the analysis of learning outcomes and students' perceptions of the gamified experience in terms of engagement and pleasantness. A quasi-experiment was conducted within an undergraduate course on educational technologies, involving about 400 students. Learning improvements were measured through a pre- and posttest, and students' perceptions were elicited through a questionnaire. Data analysis showed a high level of student satisfaction and an overall improvement of learning outcomes due to the use of game-based student response systems. However, differences in terms of effectiveness were found according to the nature of the topics dealt with in the course, that is, whether or not they were used in the development of theoretical knowledge rather than the use of that knowledge in a more practical context.

AB Formative peer assessment is widely used in education to foster student learning. However, it is critical to provide students with assessment training before engaging them in peer assessment, as students may not be capable of understanding marking criteria and critically assessing their peers. The present study examined the effects of gamed-based assessment training on students' assessment skills and intrinsic motivation. A sample of 48 students participated in two peer assessment training modules; one control group was given the traditional, calibrated training and the treatment group received the game-based training. Data analysis indicated no significant difference in students' assessment skills between the two groups. Nevertheless, students in the game-based group showed a significantly higher level of intrinsic motivation than students in the calibrated training group. Qualitative analysis of students' reflection essays confirmed the quantitative findings that game-based training may have improved students' intrinsic motivation. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB This project aimed to develop an engaging formative assessment that simulates the social and dialogic processes that are often missing in traditional instruction and assessment of argumentation. In this article, we describe the design of an argumentative reasoning task within a scenario-based assessment enhanced with game elements (Seaball-Semester at Sea). This Seaball task requires students to classify foods as "junk food" or not, by identifying relevant evidence to support their decisions and evaluating reasoning errors in others' arguments. Data from a small-scale study of 42 middle school students revealed that students performed significantly better on questions requiring selection of appropriate evidence than questions requiring identification of logical fallacies. Additionally, students' total scores were significantly correlated with external measures of argumentation skills, and with teacher's ratings of their argumentative writing skills. Survey indicated that students perceived the game-enhanced scenario-based assessment as engaging. Implications for formative assessment are discussed.

AB Several previous studies have indicated that secondary school students face problems in digital situations. Digital citizenship is therefore an essential conception for fostering students' correct behaviour and safe daily life habits while using computer and communication technologies. However, scholars have indicated the challenges of promoting students' digital citizenship owing to the lack of opportunities to situate them in decision-making situations. The advancement of computer and multimedia technologies has encouraged an increasing number of studies on digital game-based learning, which provides students with opportunities to experience various situations, and to cope with problems encountered in daily life. Several previous studies have indicated that digital game-based learning environments with proper learning strategies might help students realize the importance and meaning of digital citizenship. To address this issue, this study proposes a formative assessment-based contextual gaming approach to guide students to make decisions and to monitor their learning during the gaming process. A digital game-based learning environment was developed based on this approach, and a quasi-experiment on the digital citizenship topic was conducted in northern Thailand to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhanced the students' digital citizenship behaviours, but also promoted their motivations and perceptions.

AB Background: Kahoot! was implemented as a strategy to help students in two programs meet problem-solving competencies. Kahoot! is an on online interactive quiz which utilizes competitiveness, music and count down clocks as motivational engagement for students in learning, and provides opportunity to enhance skills such as problem-solving and thinking in time-sensitive situations. There is a paucity of evidence about nursing students' evaluation of using Kahoot! both for learning and testing knowledge.
   Methods: A single stage observational cross-sectional study was performed in Ireland and in Italy to evaluate first-year nursing students' experience of Kahoot to evaluate their knowledge before skills laboratories.
   Results: First-year nursing students (n = 83) were involved in this study, 41 in Dublin and 42 in Rome, respectively. About 66.19% of students reported strong agreement with the tool's utility.
   Conclusions: Findings show that students found Kahoot easy to use, helpful for learning especially in relation to formative assessment and impactful in preparing them for the practical part of the course. Educators could use game-based learning to engage students especially for the practical laboratories that are an important part of the nursing course.

AB The amount of data is exploding, and by all estimations will continue its exponential growth. This has led to an increased demand for engineers and data scientists. However, courses imparting crucial ideas from data design, administration and maintenance to data analytics and knowledge discovery remain under-subscribed due to perceived difficulty, low interest and motivation. This motivation can be represented by three constructs: interest in the topic, personal control and difficulty of the exercise. Role-playing games (RPGs) have been proven to stimulate students interest in analysis and problem solving when faced with varying tasks. This paper investigates the integration of specific game-based elements and pop-culture references into course delivery and assessment to boost interest and learner motivation in an elective postgraduate database systems course at The University of the West Indies. The experimental setup for assessment of students' progress in this course uses an experience point (XP) level-based system adapted from popular RPGs. To further stimulate interest, pop-culture references to specific animated series' and fantasy game genres are used. A student can choose to take one of multiple paths for their learning, representing different tools/platforms that can be used in implementation and analysis. Students can attempt more than one path for more experience and higher levels, although it is not expected. Completion of each path indicates formative "mastery" of the selected data science tool/platform. Summative assessments uses a "raid-party system" where students who have been encouraged along different paths are now asked to join together to 1. analyse given datasets and capture their findings in the format of an academic paper, and 2. build a complete database application for a particular scenario. Formative feedback is done in groups to leverage scaffolding. Measurement of the students' activity and interest is done using automatically generated activity logs from the online delivery course system as well as administration of an online electronic questionnaire. Both of these instruments are used to determine how effective this approach is in influencing students' interest and motivation. More than 5 times the historical enrollment numbers have been observed and initial results point to improvement in students' attitudes toward the content. This action research would be used to inform content delivery and further investigations would determine the impact on student performance.

AB This study aims to determine students' perception of game-based learning platform as a learning evaluation medium. The approach used in this research is descriptive quantitative, and qualitative-the instrument used in the form of a questionnaire containing 22 questions and interviews. The research was conducted in two analytical chemistry classes at a public university in Indonesia. Researchers used Kahoot every two weeks over four months as a tool for formative assessment. Three students from each class were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of Kahoot. Questionnaire data were processed using descriptive statistics, while data from interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings show that chemistry education students' perception of game-based learning platform as a learning evaluation medium is quite good. Students also perceived that Kahoot provided a challenge in learning. Kahoot is also a fun and exciting assessment medium for students. In addition, students feel that their learning motivation has increased in preparing the material to be tested, so direct feedback from Kahoot is very effective in correcting mistakes.

AB Innovation has allowed for and developed new ways of teaching and learning. Gamification is among the new training methodologies, which is a didactic approach based on the game structure with an attractive component for students. Within gamification, flipped learning and problem-based learning, escape rooms can be found as a technical aspect, which is focused on providing enigmas and tracks for the various educational content that students have assimilated through learning based on problem solving. The aim of this study is to identify how the use of gamification with the use of educational escape rooms affects activation and absence of a negative effect on students. 61 Master students of the Autonomous City of Ceuta participated in this case study. They were divided into three study groups (1 control group; 2 experimental groups) that followed different formative actions (control group-traditional; experimental groups-escape rooms). To achieve the objectives, a mixed research design based on quantitative and qualitative techniques was followed. The instrument used for data collection was the GAMEX (Gameful Experience Scale). The results reveal that the students who had taken a gamified formative action through escape rooms obtained better assessment results in the indicators concerning motivation, teamwork, commitment, activation, and absence of a negative effect on the learning process than those with the traditional methodology.

AB Because of the heath measures taken during the outbreak of Covid-19, the lack of educational methods has become the primary concern among educational professionals who have been using technology as a motivational tool. Gamification is very important because it helps students to represent their study contents and enrich their experiences of higher education when learning in-person is unavailable during the Covid-19 period. This study seeks to present an Android-based gamification app to evaluate the effect of using gamification and e-quizzes on college students' learning. We used the visual blocks language from the MIT App Inventor platform to develop an application, available at (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_mekomerofofo.projectGamification). The participantswere students from level 2 who used digital lessons for learningMATLAB. The study included gamified learning and non-gamified learning, both integrated into lesson plans, to investigate the differences in learners' performance. Two types of quizzes were used for instruction: gamified e-quizzes and paper-based quizzes. The outcomes plainly showed that using the new gamified e-quiz was more effective than using paper-based quizzes. They are better for assessing the learning performance of the students in question, specifically in terms of formative assessment. It is very important for instructors to apply games as a modern and innovation-oriented tool through which students can be engaged in an attractive, competitive experience.

AB The fixation of formal education to measure and certify academic attainment, continues to fuel the ubiquity of standardised assessment procedures. As such, educators are reluctant to embrace the same constructivist and novel stance adopted towards learning to the assessment domain and continue to favour summative over formative practices. On the other hand, literature on games in education, suggests that well-designed digital games support and enhance the positive interplay between the different forms and functions of assessment, which are inherent to the learning environment. This paper examines the principles of good game design in light of the constructive interaction that exists between learning and the different functions of assessment in games. For instance, levelling and collecting badges whilst climbing up the ladder of challenges found in games, can be considered as the outcome of a purely summative assessment of the player's progress, as the information collected during gameplay is solely used to judge and certify the player's performance. However and more importantly, both for the game designers and the players, the game is continuously producing immediate performance feedback in the form of, amongst others, both on-demand and just-in-time information, which informs the players' learning and allows them to adjust their actions, thus serving as a formative assessment of gameplay. On analysing the respective literature in the field of game studies and assessment, this paper discusses a number of game elements and core mechanics, under three broad themes, namely (i) adaptivity (ii) feedforward and (iii) distributed cognition, which game designers successfully deploy in good game designs. These are gradually and naturally extended towards the theoretical and practical underpinning of an assessment for learning pedagogy, thus potentially informing and transforming traditional assessment practices into a more playful experience.

AB Existing gamification services have features that preclude their use by e-learning tools. Odin is a gamification service that mimics the API of state-of-theart services without these limitations. This paper presents Odin as a gamification service for learning activities, describes its role in an e-learning system architecture requiring gamification, and details its implementation. The validation of Odin involved the creation of a small e-learning game, integrated in a Learning Management System (LMS) using the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) specification. Odin was also integrated in an e-learning tool that provides formative assessment in online and hybrid courses in an adaptive and engaging way.

   role-play
AB A learner's capability to critically reflect on an ongoing or newly accomplished learning experience, shapes their own proficiency to further connect previous knowledge to build on and construct rich meaning from new assignments (Zimmerman, 2002). These meaningful insights are essential for learners, allowing them to consider knowledge learned and apply relevant skills into different contexts and settings at a later date. Self-reflection allows students to develop their metacognition skills and work towards a practice that encourages continuous learning. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson (1974), utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/written/auditory/narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. By remixing D&D with Self-Reflection and formative assessment principles, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used as a basis to develop lifelong learning skills. This paper presents the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of the Remixed D&D: Reflection and Assessment system. The authors present a discussion of the next stage of the pilot trials and present their considerations of future work.

AB Biodiplomacy involves searching for a delicate balance and establishing a dialogue on the necessity to achieve international goals to develop the bioeconomy. The substantive basis of biodiplomacy is understanding bioresources, technological solutions for their extraction and use, indicators, and evaluation possibilities. The article is devoted to the establishment of a biodiplomatic institution. Such institutions will help young specialists in various economic sectors to develop competence approaches, acquire knowledge and build awareness that will make them competent to solve problems related to bioeconomy development and future, looking for efficient use of bio-resources and high value-added production. The aims and objectives of biodiplomatics are ambitious, which means that forms of study training must be attractive and multi-layered. Thus, the authors have analysed formative work assessment in the form of group work. With the help of a role game, the participation of different sections of society in developing the bioeconomy in agriculture, forestry and aquaculture was simulated. The article is devoted to the situation analysis, creating a model for building competencies, awareness, and knowledge of biodiplomats, and approbating it in the formative assessment work of the Riga Technical University bachelor's study program in environmental engineering, organised as a role game.

DE Gamification; Formative Assessment; Students Motivation
AB Teachers and psychologists report that students may suffer from multiple psychological issues such as lack of interest and high levels of stress during the development of final course projects. In this context, approaches such as gamification arise with the proposal of improving students motivation by bringing games elements to school. However, employing gamification into classroom is not a trivial task since, if not managed properly, students may lose their focus. In this paper we present GAMED, an assessment methodology that introduces sistematic steps to improve students engagement through gamification. We used GAMED in a class with high school students during two semesters and the results showed that it can improve aspects such as motivation, engagement, and teamwork.

AB In this paper, we review computer-based assessment for learning (CBAfL), in elementary and secondary education, as a viable way to merge instruction and assessment of students' developing proficiencies. We begin by contextualizing our topic relative to summative and formative assessment before presenting the current literature, which we categorized into the following: (a) supplementary use in classrooms, (b) web-based, and (c) data-driven, continuous CBAfL. Examples of research studies per category are provided. Findings show that using CBAfL in the classroom, via the Internet, or embedded in a game, generally enhances learning and other outcomes across a range of content areas (e.g. biology, math, and programming). One conclusion is that feedback, to be most beneficial to learning, should not be overly complex and must be used to be effective. Findings also showed that the quality of the assessment (i.e. validity, reliability, and efficiency) is unimpaired by the inclusion of feedback. The possibilities created by advances in the learning sciences, measurement, and technology have paved the way toward new assessment approaches that will support personalized learning and that can accurately measure and support complex competencies. The next steps involve evaluating the new assessments regarding their psychometric properties and support of learning.

AB The following scientific investigation article gathers the results of a case study about the integration of serious games in formative activities for faculty to acquire digital competencies. The study analyzing the level of acceptance among faculty towards Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) involved, particularly serious games, and assessing the competencies: it also describes the application of a methodology used to organize the experience of the faculty of the Atlantic Branch of the University of Costa Rica (UCR), using AstroCodigo (serious game) to approach 56 participating teachers to the use of video games in formative processes and problem-solving using algorithms. Interviews, participants' observations, surveys and focus groups were used to assess the opinion of faculty and directors. Results revealed that faculty accepts serious games and registers a change of opinion regarding the variables that influence their adoption in their teaching. In conclusion, the experience revealed motivation and the interest of participating in training activities to develop digital competencies on behalf of the academic staff. It is important to highlight the willingness of the university management authorities to support future projects and activities related to faculty professional development in digital technologies through serious games.

AB Teaching computer programming to young students is a major challenge. This paper describes a web-based course for teaching programming using visualization and a gaming theme. Concepts are taught using real world examples that the target students can identify with; in this way some of the problems related to understanding abstract concepts are alleviated and teaming occurs in context. The full range of multimedia technology including animation, sound and video are used to immerse the student in an environment where teaming is fun and visual display of the concepts reinforce teaming. A gaming theme is used for formative assessment. Students are provided with 'game' activities such as "spot the error", "predict the output" and "put in order". These enhance critical thinking. They test comprehension and knowledge as well as higher order thinking skills.

AB There are evidences that Student Response Systems (SRS) encourage student participation in the classroom by streamlining class development. Recent experiences indicate that these SRS have been used in the context of quizzes, showing that students' attention, motivation and enjoyment are increased with respect to the simple use of a simple questionnaire. The applications Socrative, Kahoot, Quizlet, Quizizz, among others, are each year more consolidated. The strategy for the development of games in the classroom is that it should be voluntary, anonymous, with a reduced cost of time (on the order of minutes). The paper shows material of Fluid Mechanics subject at university level. There is much more material in Kahoot format than in Socrative. The tool let diagnose weak points on the learning process in the classroom.

AB In this paper, we describe an effort to develop and evaluate an innovative formative assessment to gather evidence about middle school students' argumentation skills. Specifically, this game-enhanced scenario-based assessment (Seaball-Semester at Sea) includes a series of argumentative reasoning activities in the context of an extended scenario wherein students debate the issue of whether junk food should be sold to students. These activities were designed around argumentation learning progressions (i.e., hypotheses about the qualitative shifts that occur as students achieve higher levels of sophistication in argumentation) which serve as a framework to determine the targeted skills, levels and activity sequences. Performance feedback is also provided in the assessment. We conducted a pilot study, aimed at examining student performance and the validity of the tasks as a measure of argumentation skills. More than 100 middle school students completed this assessment and additional external measures of argumentation in a pre/post design. Descriptive statistics of student performance in the activities, analyses of item difficulty, and correlations are reported. Results indicated that students' total scores were significantly correlated with external measures of argumentation skills, and with students' state reading and writing test scores. In addition, students achieved higher average scores in a post-test of argumentation skills after having completed the Seaball activities. Finally, explanatory feedback about students' task performance was found to be beneficial to those who were "Below" or "Approaching" proficient on the state reading and writing test. We conclude with implications for assessment design and instruction in argumentation.

AB We present a mobile game app (EUR Game) that has been designed to complement teaching and learning in higher education. The mobile game app can be used by teachers to gauge how well students are meeting the learning objectives. Teachers can use the information to provide 'just-in-time' support and adapt their lessons accordingly. For the students, the game app is a study tool that can be used to test their own understanding and monitor their study progress. This, in turn, supports students' self-regulated learning. Gamification elements are also included in the game app to enhance the learning experience. During the demonstration, participants will experience the features of the game app and be engaged in an interactive session to explore the possible ways to use the mobile game app to support teaching and learning.

AB Authentic problem solving tasks in digital environments are often open-ended with ill-defined pathways to a goal state. Scaffolds and formative feedback during this process help learners develop the requisite skills and understanding, but require assessing the problem solving process. This paper describes a hybrid approach to assessing process at scale in the context of the use of computational thinking practices during programming. Our approach combines hypothesis driven analysis, using an evidence-centered design framework, with discovery-driven data analytics. We report on work-in-progress involving novices and expert programmers working on Blockly games.

ID TEST ANXIETY
AB Digital game-based evaluations may be useful to solve several problems of traditional paper-based assessments, such as students' test anxiety and evaluation rigidity. On the other hand, video games allow to record interaction data of the thinking process that can be used later in formative assessments. A game application was developed as a tool for evaluating the logic abilities of first year university students. The game was designed as a puzzle with different difficulty levels. Experimental results showed that the game scores were not significantly different from the grades obtained with traditional paper-based evaluations. However, for most students, the game-based interaction was significantly different by lowering perceived frustration and increasing user engagement. The use of gamification on student assessment can lower test anxiety and reveal useful insights on student thinking processes. Moreover, automatic and real time feedback could drastically improve learning and guide students to understand complex scenarios.

AB Purpose: A systematic review of the use of peer assessment in Physical Education in the last five years (2016-2020). Method: Four databases were used to select those articles that included information on peer assessment in Physical Education in the different educational stages. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, including the PICO (participants, intervention, comparators, and outcomes) strategy, after the exclusion criteria, 13 articles were fully assessed based on seven criteria: (1) year and author; (2) country; (3) educational stage; (4) type of paper; (5) purpose; (6) content; and (7) outcomes. Results: the results show that the research was geographically dispersed, although Spain and the USA had half of the articles reviewed. The research was carried out at all educational stages, although a greater focus was observed in higher education than in primary and secondary education. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research was almost equally represented, and dealt mainly with sports and games. Regarding the goals of the studies, a diversity of research so great that it produced a lack of continuity and coherence in the literature on the subject was found. The research results on the use of peer assessment showed an increase in the level of motivation, perceived teaching confidence and competence, and teaching self-efficacy. More research is needed on the benefits of the use of peer assessment on the self-regulation of learning and the critical thinking of students.

AB Peer assessment in higher education has been studied for decades. Despite the substantial amount of research carried out, peer assessment has yet to make significant advances. This review identifies themes of recent research and highlights the challenges that have hampered its advance. Most of these challenges arise from the manual nature of peer assessment practices, which prove intractable as the number of students involved increases. Practitioners of the discipline are urged to forge affiliations with closely related fields and other disciplines, such as computer science, in order to overcome these challenges.

AB The Millennial generation has grown up using computers as an essential part of their daily activities. Educators have successfully adapted formative assessments by incorporating Internet resources, gamification and pervasive technology to meet the needs of these students. However, summative assessments have changed very little. Point Barter is an online testing system that incorporates game-like features to equitably assist students in answering test questions. It allows students to dynamically trade test points for hints about the correct answer. This paper presents the results of a study that evaluated Point Barter with two sections of the same course. One section used Point Barter throughout a semester while the other used the standard testing system. Upon completion of the course, all participants took a standardized cumulative final exam. The experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group, indicating that using Point Barter throughout the semester may have led to increased learning.

AB Games are gaining momentum in the field of assessment for evaluating student performance and other complex 21st century skills. Gaming environments have the potential to provide learning activities and the opportunity to collaborate, problem solve and apply critical thinking skills. As part of the Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills (ATC21S(TM1)) project, an assessment system for assessing cognitive and non-cognitive skills have been developed. The project focuses on assessing and teaching 21st century skills and the assessment system measures these skills in an online capacity. The design of the assessment system is innovative; using data analytic techniques, Rasch analysis and automated scoring to produce instant formative reports for educators. As the first assessment system of its kind to measure 21st century skills a discussion here surrounds the requirements and deployment techniques for the design of such complex assessments from delivery to reporting, making it meaningful and useful for teachers' use in everyday classroom.

AB This study investigates to what extent the popular online gaming platform called Kahoot can be used as a creative and effective tool to promote motivation, engagement and meaningful learning. For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with a sample of 101 undergraduate students of education who participated in online Kahoot quizzes by designing their own questions as part of the formative assessment. According to the results of the pre- and post-tests, the integration of this game-based student response system into the teaching process improved students' perception of certain concepts in social science teaching, increased their active participation in the lesson, and motivated them towards learning in a more interactive and stimulating environment. Therefore, it is recommended to take gamification to a whole new level with attractive digital participation platforms to increase motivation and enhance students' learning experience in higher education contexts.

AB A high educational value of computer games in formal learning seems to be an important reason to use gaming in the classroom. However, this value is not necessarily realized by the use of games and a conscious use is important. In this study, primary school students get the opportunity to play games related to the core objectives of education on the subjects of math, spelling and geography. It is investigated whether greater awards will change the decision behavior of the students in choosing games on specific subjects and the subsequent consequence on the assessment. Results show no significant relation between awarding and subject choice. Neither an effect has been found on the relation of practice time and learning outcomes. A large significant association is found between different practice times on the different subjects. A positive intrinsic motivation of the students has been found for learning in general and learning with games.

AB This study investigated whether reflective class feedback (RCF) boosts the effectiveness of mobile gamified quizzing in enhancing active learning in higher education. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design was adopted in this study to measure the effect of mobile gamified quizzing with and without RCF on students' achievement. Two intact groups of EFL first-year undergraduates in a Grammar course at Ibn Zohr university, Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences, participated in this study. One group played the mobile gamified quizzes with RCF, while the other played the same mobile gamified quizzes without RCF. The findings showed that the students who played the mobile gamified quizzes with RCF scored significantly higher than those who played the same gamified quizzes without RCF. These findings yielded a number of theoretical and practical implications for the effective use of mobile gamified quizzing.

AB We describe an education model that was developed and put in place to improve student engagement and attainment in a first year undergraduate programming course.
   The work is founded in a checkpoint-based formative assessment experiment undertaken for two years, the success of which is analysed in this document. The results provide evidence leading to a move towards a blended model of education, which requires the design of a software application to support the system. We present the main features of that application, covering aspects that range from traditional approaches and established delivery methods, to e-learning and MOOCs with, for instance, gamification.
   This blended model of education fosters the development of a teaching practice that adapts to student diversity through informed teaching

AB Providing formative feedback to each student on mechanism-type problems in organic chemistry is challenging, especially in large classes. With the wide availability of touch screen devices, an opportunity for assessment through a mobile, game-based learning experience involving the curved arrow notation of organic chemistry mechanisms was devised. From conception to development and early testing, as well as improvements made based on instructor and student feedback, this chapter details the creation of the Mechanisms app. Also included are results of preliminary research studies on the use of Mechanisms by students and instructors, use cases of Mechanisms in active learning activities, and an example of pattern recognition from data collected by the app.

AB Students' active participation to large bachelor courses (i.e. courses with hundred or more attendants) is difficult to stimulate and monitor. As a result, many students may defer studying until shortly before the exam, wasting their time and loosing contact with the courses, where they continue to show up but are unable to harvest useful knowledge. To cure the problem, we devised a computer-supported methodology based to an implicit form of collaboration/ competition: a sort of serious social game where students are requested to formulate questions for their peers, propose answer and choose the best responses. Evaluation of such approach yields results, which students perceive as excellent.

AB This paper describes an approach, where an exploration-based simulation environment for conducting and observing science experiments is combined with a game environment to provide a learning environment that supports learning with understanding and transfer. We describe the components of the learning environment that includes active controls to create an "inspectable" simulation, and a formative assessment scheme that aids monitoring and learning for novice learners. A preliminary experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the simulation environment. In future, ef we will extend this environment by linking it to our teachable agent system, Betty's Brain, and develop a simulation-based "game" environment that includes a sequence of challenges to further motivate the student and expand their learning abilities.

AB Operation Aries is a computer environment that helps students learn about scientific methods and inquiry The system has several components designed to optimize learning and motivation, such as game features, animated agents. natural language communication, trialogues among agents. an eBook. multimedia, and formative assessment. The present focus is on a Case Study learning module that involves critiquing reports of scientific findings in news media that have flawed scientific methodology. After the human student lists the methodological flaws of a Case Study in natural language, a teacher agent and a peer agent hold a trialogue with the student that evaluates each listed flaw and that uncovers additional flaws that that student missed

ID MOTIVATION
AB Students attend the first sessions of your units and then disappear, some of them forever, and some of them have no clue what is going on or they work for other units' assessments. When it comes to providing them with formative assessment, it is not always well received as it is perceived as extra work. The purpose of this article is to define a gamification framework based on structural gamification that focuses on that weak part of your cohorts that do not engage as much, and it does that in a great way, as it embeds video game rules and role-playing into the curriculum. This is achieved through implementing game elements to the entire second-year cohort (N = 34) of computer game development students, in the unit 'Engineering Software Systems'. The goal is to motivate and engage the at-risk students of the cohort with lower activity, attendance and involvement in the unit.

AB Students need to monitor their progress constantly to improve their performance, and with large classes at university level education, both online and offline, most instructors are not able to provide individual students with progress reports other than separate assignments or exam results. Some e-learning systems track students' progress; however, these traditional personalised e-learning systems hide students' data; thus, students are not provided with the full picture of their progress and are unable to position themselves among their peers. This research aims to introduce a way to track English language learners' progress through an interactive gamified social visualisation tool in the form of a car race game without jeopardising student privacy or hiding crucial progress information. The results of this study showed that social comparison of students' progress and the gamification aspects of the tool made students more engaged and motivated to win the race, which affected their academic performance positively.

AB The educational value of play has long been acknowledged. During recent decades, much attention has been paid to video games and the multifarious ways in which they can promote and enhance learning. My main objective in this study is to weave game principles, learning and the notion of playfulness into assessment principles, in an attempt to investigate how what I call 'Game-Informed Playful Assessment' (GIPA) can affect student learning and particularly students' experienceoflearning. The GIPA was designed with a view to promoting students' agency, autonomy, collaboration and playfulness, and was introduced in an undergraduate course on Archaic Greek Lyric poetry at a Greek-speaking university. My data was generated through in-depth interviews with ten of the students that attended the course. While the GIPA was favourably and even enthusiastically received by students, the research also brought to the fore several other issues that call for attention, such as the stress that innovative assessment may provoke in students, and the readiness of students to be playful within an academic framework that typically contrasts serious work with playfulness and play in general.

AB Electronic voting systems, also known as Audience Response Systems, or clickers, which directly introduce dialogue and interactivity between teacher and student, have been used successfully within the context of the university classroom for the last decade. Quite a few mobile voting tools (Socrative, PollEverywhere, Xorro-Q, Mentimeter, MbClick, The SMART Response interactive response system, etc.) are currently available. Many researchers have analyzed the best pedagogical practices for using these tools: they allow for anonymous participation and add a game approach to the classroom environment; peer evaluation mediated by polling tools provides honest, constructive feedback and promotes more engaged class discussion, they can promote deep learning when teaching and questioning strategies center on higher-level thinking skills; increase student engagement providing prompt feedback and help design formative assessment activities.
   The objective of the international research study Enhancing Technology Awareness and Usage of m-Learning in Russia and Norway was to evaluate the pedagogical impact of a mobile voting tool Student Response System (SRS) on creating a collaborative environment for university lecture courses. The analysis was based on quantitative data (test score) collected from two student groups (56 students) of Lomonosov Moscow State University (Russia). As part of a comparative experimental study, this research quantitatively compares student's test scores across two student groups. This data was combined with that from a qualitative attitudinal student survey. Research indicates that a SRS supported approach influenced important aspects of lecture design such as time management, the mode of material presentation and activity switch patterns. In addition, the SRS was also found to impact on learner-teacher interactions, student collaboration and output, and formats of activities and tasks. The framework of the SRS supported lectures can help instructors gradually get the grasp of a new type of digital classroom -flipped classroom, and then, in the long run, MOOC lecturing.

AB Although ecological systems at varying scales involve non-linear interactions, learners insist thinking in a linear fashion when they deal with ecological phenomena. The overall objective of the present contribution was to propose a hypothetical learning progression for developing non-linear reasoning in prey-predator systems and to provide empirical evidence for one part of this progression. Pre-service teachers followed three teaching units that involved a game simulation of the prey-predator system. Participants predicted how wolf and deer populations would evolve in a hypothetical forest, and then they used the simulation to generate data, construct a graph, describe their graph, and compare their predictions with graph description. A new learning context was introduced and new predictions were requested to investigate whether participants would transfer former learning experiences in the new setting. Analysis of learning products revealed the messy character of learners' intermediate steps. Some participants succeeded in identifying aspects of metamodeling knowledge, but this was not used in their new predictions. Graph description could either perpetuate or challenge linear heuristics depending on the strategy participants followed. There were a number of participants who misrepresented prey and predator population trends as inversely proportional, which indicated that there is a possibility of regression to the lower anchor. Linearity and proportionality might have re-surfaced during the learning activity sequence and linear heuristics could have been so powerful as to distract learners' attention from axes labels. Learning products constructed by learners during learning activities included crucial benchmarks to diagnose learner performance and indicated proper timing for feedback provision. Overall, the implications of the study highlight the importance of using learning products to enact formative assessment. Directions for future research are discussed.

ID FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; METAANALYSIS
AB Although the importance of cognitive feedback in digital serious games (DSG) is undisputed, we are facing some major design challenges. First of all, we do not know to which extend existing research guidelines apply when we stand the risk of cognitive feedback distorting the delicate balance between learning and playing. Unobtrusive cognitive feedback has to be interspersed with gameplay. Second, many effective solutions for providing cognitive feedback we do know might simply be too costly. To face both challenges, this study offers an efficient approach for providing unobtrusive and retrospective cognitive feedback (RCF) in DSG. This approach was applied onto a game where feedback messages were triggered via simple rules about learners' questioning behavior on four dimensions. We found the experimental condition including such RCF to yield better learning outcomes while maintaining similar motivation.

AB The Millennial Generation is entering the Higher Education (hereinafter HE) with expectations of Higher Teaching and Learning. Correspondingly, the HE institutions have attempted to make their pedagogy student-centred. This paper argues that there is scope for a gamified, student-centred assessment regime that would lead to higher levels of student engagement. Such assessment regime would utilise gaming principles and personal narratives to engage students. This work argues that the underlying gamified narrative based pedagogy has the potential to be universal and interdisciplinary. The assessment regime suggested was implemented in two different contexts and within two different subdisciplines with two different student cohorts producing mixed results. The validity of this pedagogy, especially its universality claim, is critically examined in light of these results.

AB The present study aims to explore the impact of three reward strategies on adult e-learners' learning performance in a gamified teaching process. One hundred and eighty participants who were recruited for the experiment were evenly assigned to three groups, with Group A adopting the forfeit-or-prize reward strategy, Group B employing the prize-only reward strategy, and Group C applying the no-prize-no-forfeit strategy. A pretest, an immediate posttest, a delayed posttest and two questionnaires were adopted as instruments for the study. The results showed that the forfeit-or-prize pattern and the prize-only pattern could exert a significantly better impact on the e-learners' learning than the no-prize-no-forfeit pattern. Additionally, the forfeit-or prize pattern elicited better knowledge retention than the prize-only pattern. The two questionnaires revealed that the forfeit-or-prize pattern and the prize-only pattern could stimulate students' motivation in learning, although a high-level anxiety was perceived by the subjects assigned to the forfeit-or-prize pattern. Possible explanations and implications are discussed.

AB In a large-scale quantitative study that adopted a learning analytics approach, we searched for associations between students' activity in a game-based online mathematics learning environment and their mathematics achievements on a national standardized test. Students were active in the environment throughout the school year, and particularly during an online National Mathematics Olympiad (N = 239 schools). Overall, our findings point to a positive association between online game-based activity during the Olympiad and mathematics test scores. This association remained even after controlling for socioeconomic factors, which are known to contribute to academic achievements. The paper discusses these findings and suggests evidence for causality, in particular cognitive, meta-cognitive, and affective effects of the online activity that may have positively affected test scores.

AB The present study investigates the extent to which the popular game-based online platform of Kahoot can be used as a creative and effective tool in the teaching practice and specifically in the teaching of basic concepts of electric circuits. A comparative study was conducted for this reason with two groups of 67 learners in total, where the experimental group participated in the design of their own questions within the framework of formative assessment with the use of Kahoot, whereas the second group followed a traditional way for their assessment. According to the results, the integration of Kahoot in the teaching process improved learners' understanding of certain concepts on electric circuits, enhanced their active participation in the lesson, motivated them towards learning and constituted a creative and fun-tool to use for teaching purposes.

AB The present study examined whether socio-motivational effects from working with a Teachable Agent (TA) might transfer from the formative learning phase to a summative test situation. Forty-nine students (9-10 years old) performed a digital pretest of math skills, then played a TA-based educational math game in school over a period of eight weeks. Thereafter, the students were divided into two groups, matched according to their pretest scores, and randomly assigned one of two posttest conditions: either with the TA present, or without the TA. Results showed that low-performers on the pretest improved significantly more on the posttest than did high-performers, but only when tested with the TA. We reason that low-performers might be more susceptible to a supportive social context as provided by their TA for performing well in a test situation.

DT Article
DE ARG; pedagogical games; chemistry teaching
AB This paper presents the application of a Short ARG built to be applied in a single class, instead of a longer interval, as it is common in strategies such as ARG. ARGs are games based on role-playing experiences that involve role playing using a particular place, in this case, two classrooms and an education lab. Whereas ARG's characters are the participants/players themselves, in this study, they were the Chemistry undergraduate students. The students/players were aimed of various clues and moments involving chemical concepts to find a lost student. We could notice ARG can be a teaching strategy, we mean, an alternative for conceptual discussion in the classroom as well as a diagnostic and formative assessment tool, characteristic of the use of games and recreational activities in teaching scientific concepts.

DE Pedagogical design; Microinteractions; Gamification
AB This paper describes a pedagogical design to capture 21st Century Skills. The pedagogical design includes three key components: a pedagogical frame, a gamification framework, and microinteraction-based interaction design. The focus was on secondary education (K-12), but the pedagogical design is generic and flexible enough to be appropriated for other purposes. Moreover, the paper describes how the three components of the pedagogical design can be implemented into a software tool for authentic classroom environments and informal settings. The tool would allow the capturing of 21 st Ce. Skills, their formative assessment, and the metacognitive awareness of skill development. The contribution of this project is twofold: firstly, the production of a concrete set of pedagogical design guidelines and, secondly, design guidelines towards the implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype for use in classroom environments.

AB Training processes are characterized by the multiplicity of methodological approaches on which they can be based. In this sense, gamification constitutes a tool with an important potential in the design and implementation of formative actions. In this perspective, the present article seeks to know the assessment of the Degree in Primary Education's students about the usefulness of gamification as a resource for teaching and learning, after a gamified experience. It was also intended to identify possible gender and age differences. The sample, composed by 83 students, assessed the resource using an ad hoc instrument for this research. The instrument collected socio-demographic information and was divided into three basic dimensions for the methodology's evaluation: communicative, instrumental and pedagogical. The results show that the students perceive as useful the methodology in its three dimensions (especially the communicative and pedagogical ones), with a positive correlation between all of them. The methodology is perceived as particularly relevant for the development of written expression, meaningful learning, the feedback promotion, the promotion of group work or to present complex content in more attractive formats. In addition, no significant differences have been detected in terms of sex, but in terms of age, with higher assessments of the resource being linked to a younger age of the participants.

AB Mobile technologies are ubiquitous in the lives of our students. Rather than seeing the presence of these devices in the classroom as a hindrance or a distraction, educators should embrace the opportunities for greater student engagement, collaboration and useful feedback.
   This paper reports some uses of mobile technologies in classrooms at UTS Insearch and the responses of science and engineering students. We hope that our reflections will be a useful guide to other educators and suggest simple ways to integrate flipped learning and gamification into undergraduate classrooms.
   UTS Insearch has a blended learning approach to teaching where students learn through seamless integration of technology-enhanced strategies and face-to-face activities. We focus on our experiences using learning tools, such as Kahoot! and Mentimeter, to demonstrate practical applications of gamification in science and engineering classrooms.
   The teaching style used in Australian universities incorporating student-centred flipped learning is foreign to many students, especially those from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds, but data from surveys and reflections allow us to conclude that a majority of students value the use of emerging technologies in learning and that they assist with motivation, formative assessment, collaborative learning and student engagement.

   Computer-managed instruction; e-Learning motivation and e-assessments
AB Virtual education is one of the most significant tools in what EU Commission calls Lifelong Learning (LLL), and learners' engagement is a capital aspect to succeed in any online formative activities. Therefore, this paper is devoted to reach three main objectives to improve virtual formative experiences:
   Identifying which motivational factors are more significant in e-Learning/blended-learning processes as well as in technology-supported on-campus teaching. Discovering which kinds of digital and 2.0 tools for creating multimedia educational resources are best considered according to their capacity to keep students engaged in virtual educative projects. Clarifying which types of learning products (that is, e-assessments) are most suitable to help e-learners acquire good quality knowledge along with practical competences while keeping motivation throughout the course.
   In order to achieve these aims, it was developed a research process focused on the aforementioned subjects and based on building a specific questionnaire with 36 questions (in four sections) about motivation in e-learning, keeping in mind the conclusions derived from a previous literature review. This questionnaire was filled in by 65 experts on e-Learning and hybrid teaching (mainly from Spain and South America) whom were connected by emailing. After applying qualitative statistical analysis to their responses, several interesting conclusions came up, such as:
   Awakening students' sensible curiosity by means of a suitable diversity in how contents are presented will improve grades and levels of satisfaction. Including an equalitarian and integrative internal motivational system will increase engagement and retention. Accessibility is a key point in relation to how e-learners get engaged in an educative project and get benefits from it. This is particularly important in the early stages of the course.
   And some other evidences that are described in the paper. This research will be useful to develop new instructional design models centered in getting and keeping e-learners' attention and motivation through involving new techniques like gamification or creative problem-solving activities. Besides, these results will help educators discover the main factors they should pay attention when designing e-learning tasks and selecting web 2.0 tools for the 21st century students.

AB Games-based Learning (GBL) is developing a reputation with some educationalists as a useful supplementary approach for teaching and learning. Two important issues for GBL application developers and educationalists are how the learning is actually assessed within a GBL environment and how assessment is integrated into a GBL application. This paper presents the preliminary results of a systematic literature review on assessment integration in GBL and highlights the state of the literature in this area by outlining important papers to act as a guide for educationalists tackling this important issue. This paper defines assessment and discusses formative and summative assessment and embedded and external assessment, but is primarily interested in integrating assessment into games-based learning applications. A discussion of traditional assessment approaches and assessment approaches in GBL are presented. Finally the paper presents the preliminary findings of the literature review and proposes a model/framework for educationalists to incorporate assessment into a GBL application.

AB Suppose learners use their free time to go online to review course materials, and they do so by taking optional tests that consist of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). What will happen if, for every practice question, there is always a choice (out of four possible choices) that is marked as "the (current) hot choice?" Will this make any difference in learning effects? To answer this question, an educational experiment was conducted. It was found that "hot designations" helped the experimental group perform significantly better in both the immediate post-test exam and a delayed post-test exam and that learners with higher levels of initial knowledge benefited more from this review strategy. From the results of a follow-up questionnaire and one-on-one interviews, it was found that the proposed review strategy promoted a more thorough thinking style in subjects of the experimental group.

AB Innovative practice in a classroom adds challenges and tensions to programs and institutional structures in higher education. With the recent emphasis on curricula reform, there is a great focus on assessment and pedagogical practices to support student learning. To illustrate the tensions arising from these efforts, we present four pedagogical and assessment innovation approaches using both Shulman's (2005) Signature Pedagogies and Tatar's (2007) Design Tensions frameworks. The four approaches include problem-based learning, game-based learning, case-based learning, and technology-enhanced learning. A narrative for each approach examines and addresses tensions using Shulman's (2005) surface, deep and implicit structures. We argue that there is an interconnected complexity and conflicting visions among the micro- (e.g., classroom or practicum), meso- (e.g., program), and macro- (e.g., institution) levels. We acknowledge that dynamic tensions continually exist and needs to be thoughtfully navigated in support of innovative assessment and pedagogies in higher education.

AB The research features the results of the effective introduction of information and communication technologies (ICT) into the process of senior preschoolers' moral education in preschool educational institutions (PEI). The benefits of ICT implementation in preschool education in different countries are discussed, and the balance between ICT and moral education is clarified. The necessity to find new approaches to increase the level of senior preschoolers' moral education was emphasized, which determined the topicality of the raised scientific problem. An experimental study of ICT implementation in the senior preschoolers' (n = 432) moral education was conducted, which included constitutive, formative and control stages. Criteria (cognitive, emotional and value-oriented, behavioral), their indexes and levels of senior preschoolers' moral education were specified. Based on the diagnostic method "Me and My Friends", the initial levels (high, sufficient, medium and low) were determined. An experimental method of ICT implementation in senior preschoolers' moral education is presented. This method was developed considering the requirements of the Basic Component of Preschool Education of Ukraine (2021) and partial program (additional thematic program on the organization of moral education in preschool education) "Treasury of Morality" (2020). The method is aimed at building children's positive attitude to ICT as a source of information that promotes the consolidation of knowledge about moral norms and development of skills of moral behaviour in society. The educational potential of ICT is analyzed, which should be implemented to increase the level of senior preschoolers' moral education, namely: videos, multimedia presentations, cartoons, video tales, online games, smart cards etc. The sequence of the method implementation at the information-introductory, reconstructive-formative and affirmative-consolidating stages is revealed. The effectiveness of ICT implementation in the senior preschoolers' moral education was assessed at the control stage. Positive dynamics of high and sufficient levels in senior preschoolers' moral education in the experimental group (EG) is proved to have risen. Importance of the ICT introduction into the modern system of senior preschoolers' moral education of PEI is confirmed. The following prospective directions of the initiated study are outlined: interaction with parents in the context of children's moral education involving ICT, ensuring consistency of PEI and primary school in children's moral education, as well as the development of moral competence of university students majoring in "Preschool education".

AB Social science education aims to enable people to acquire the knowledge and abilities necessary to lead a normal social life. However, social science is often neglected in basic education compared with languages and mathematics, thus affecting students' learning motivation and achievements. In this study, a digital game-based review system was designed for fourth-grade students in Taiwan taking a social science course. The students could review the unit content through the completion of game tasks. The concepts of the forgetting curve, hierarchy of learning, and formative assessment were incorporated into the game design to solidify memory and optimize learning effectiveness. The effects of the game on learning effectiveness, motivation, attitude, and interest were investigated, and learning behavior patterns were assessed through lag sequential analysis. The findings may serve as a reference for improving elementary school social science education.

AB Flipped classrooms continue to grow in popularity across all levels of education. Following this pedagogical trend, the present study aimed to enhance the face-to-face instruction in flipped classrooms with the use of clickers. A game-like clicker application was implemented through a bring your own device (BYOD) model to gamify classroom dynamics in the spirit of question-and-answer competitions. A series of flipped learning lessons were created for the study, with clickers integrated into question-and-answer activities associated with each of the lessons as formative assessments to assist students in the learning of English as a foreign language. In this quasi-experimental research, the data were gathered using a summative assessment, a perception survey, and individual interviews. The collected data were then analyzed to compare the students' flipped learning experiences, with or without clicker use. The results indicated that the gamified use of clickers had positive influences on student learning, with regard to their performance, perceptions, and preferences. This study thus suggests that the emerging generation of clicker technology allows for a cost-effective BYOD integration model in flipped classrooms, through which it is possible to seamlessly bridge pre-class and in-class activities and to effectively promote student learning.

AB This paper analyzes the links that exist between the perceptions of teachers-in-training regarding the use of digital resources in the Secondary Education classroom and their own methodological and epistemological conceptions. Shulman's theories continue to largely guide current research on teacher knowledge. However, the impact caused by the new technologies has inspired new approaches like T-PACK, which put the focus on the teachers' digital competence. In order to address this goal, information has been collected by means of a questionnaire implemented in 22 universities, 13 Spanish (344 participants) and 9 British (162 participants). The analysis of data was conducted along three phases: a) examination of the structure of assessments regarding the usefulness of digital resources by analyzing latent classes; b) estimation of confirmatory factor models for variable evaluation processes, History as a formative subject and historical competencies; c) estimation of interclass differences by using confirmatory factor models. The results showed four types of response regarding the use of digital resources in the classroom that were polarized about two items: comics and video games. Important interclass differences have likewise been found regarding methodological issues (traditional and innovative practices), as well as less important differences concerning epistemological conceptions and views on the development of historical competencies in the classroom.

   Approach to Continuous Assessment

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; UNIVERSITY; STUDENTS; LEVEL
AB Learning is a non-deterministic complex dynamical system where students transform inputs (classes, assignments, personal work, gamification activities, etc.) into outcomes (acquired knowledge, skills, and competencies). In the process, students generate outputs in a variety of ways (exams, tests, portfolios, etc.). The result of these outputs is a grade aimed at measuring the (level of) competencies achieved by each student. We revisit the relevance of continuous assessment to obtain this grading. We simultaneously investigate the generated outputs in different moments as modifiers of the system itself, since they may reveal a variation of the level of competencies achievement previously assessed. This is a novelty in the literature, and a cornerstone of our methodology. This process is called a Dynamical Continuous Discrete assessment, which is a form of blended assessment that may be used under traditional or blended learning environments. This article provides an 11-year perspective of applying this Dynamical Continuous Discrete assessment in a Mathematics class for aerospace engineering students, as well as the students' perception of continuous assessments.

AB Formative assessment is a crucial element of teaching and learning which allows students to identify challenging course concepts and enables educators to assess the effectiveness of their teaching strategies. Web-based student response systems have gained popularity for their ability to provide instant feedback to students and instructors while simultaneously promoting active learning and student engagement. Kahoot!, a competitive game-based student response system, has recently been used to assess students at various academic levels across numerous disciplines, though its effectiveness in undergraduate general chemistry classrooms remains unclear. This paper presents the use of Kahoot! during sequential semesters of General Chemistry I and II with the same group of undergraduate students. The utility of using Kahoot! as an assessment tool is evaluated by analyzing anonymous student feedback surveys. The student response to using Kahoot! is encouraging and indicates that Kahoot! may be an enjoyable, engaging, and effective assessment tool when used in undergraduate general chemistry classrooms.

AB Objectives: To assess the satisfaction of first-year dental students with gamification and its effect on perceived and actual improvement of academic writing.
   Methods: Two first-year classes of dental undergraduate students were recruited for the study which extended over 4 months and ended in January 2015. A pre-intervention assessment of students' academic writing skills was performed using criteria to evaluate writing. The same criteria were used to evaluate the final writing assignment after the intervention. Students' satisfaction with game aspects was assessed. The per cent change in writing score was regressed on scores of satisfaction with game aspects controlling for gender. Perceived improvement in writing was also assessed.
   Results: Data from 87 (94.6%) students were available for analysis. Students' overall satisfaction with the gamified experience was modest [mean (SD) = 5.9 (2.1)] and so was their overall perception of improvement in writing [mean (SD) = 6.0 (2.2)]. The per cent score of the first assignment was 35.6 which improved to 80 in the last assignment. Satisfaction with playing the game was significantly associated with higher percentage of improvement in actual writing skills [regression coefficient (95% confidence interval) = 21.1 (1.9, 40.2)].
   Conclusion: Using gamification in an obligatory course for first-year dental students was associated with an improvement in academic writing skills although students' satisfaction with game aspects was modest and their willingness to use gamification in future courses was minimal.

AB Nowadays, there is a lot of discussion regarding teaching methods, their characteristics and potential, as well as their limitations. Aiming to encourage new methodologies for the teaching of chemistry in higher education, a novel didactic game was developed and applied in order to provide parallel support to undergraduate chemistry students learning about molecular symmetry. This educational resource was well-accepted by the students and was found to be a ludic evaluation tool for the study of symmetry. The game was applied to undergraduate chemistry sophomores and was found to be a powerful tool to improve students' skills in several topics, including molecular geometry, spatial molecular projections, and electronic and vibrational spectroscopy. During the activities, students participated by sharing their doubts about the presence of symmetry. In this paper, we report and discuss the results of the experimental use of this new resource developed for the teaching of molecular symmetry.

DE instructional strategies; object-oriented programming; scoping review
AB Computer Science degree students commonly have a high failure rate in object-oriented programming (OOP). To reduce the failure rate is needed that teachers use techniques to motivate and help students in keep their focus attention; to help students to organize their information for understanding and remembering, and to enable teachers to monitor and assess their learning. These techniques are called instructional strategies. In this paper, we present a scoping review of to answer the research question: What are the instructional strategies that have been most successful use for teaching object-oriented programming at the undergraduate level? The review was performed using three electronic databases: SCOPUS, ERIC and JSTOR. Searching period was from 01/01/2006 to 12/31/2016. Our results show some instructional strategies used in object-oriented programming in the last ten years. These are: blended learning, project based learning, object-first, iterative learning, instructional games, formative assessment, educational programming environments, bottom-up and top-down approaches, and interactive visualizations.

AB Games with educational purposes usually follow a computer-assisted instruction concept that is predefined and rigid, offering no adaptability to each student. To overcome such problem, some ideas from Intelligent Tutoring Systems have been used in educational games such as teaching introductory programming. The objective of this study was to advance Online Game-based Bayesian Intelligent Tutoring System (OGITS) to enhance programming acquisition and online information searching skills, thus improving students' ability in web-based problem solving through board games. The study sample comprised 79 college students in introductory level Computer Science classes. Qualitative and quantitative data were then gathered. Results of this study revealed generally favorable opinions about OGITS. As OGITS targets individual knowledge acquisition of computer programming and web-based problem-solving skills, it offers a suitable learning environment for students both as a stand-alone course and as a supplement to traditional classroom settings.

AB Smart learning environments (SLEs) are spaces that incorporate technology to improve students learning outcomes. This growing body of literature typically examines day-to-day learning, but very little research considers the use of these environments for formative and summative assessment. We investigate how SLEs can be used to conduct successful real time simulations for summative assessment, using an innovative crisis management simulation in a unique smart learning environment at the University of South Wales. Using a PLS SEM methodology, this research demonstrates that the psychological factors of social support and career relatedness show significant positive effects upon perceived learning. Surprisingly, the perceived ease of use of the technology does not significantly affect perceived learning. This research contributes a valuable understanding of simulation learning within SLEs, and its relationship to positive outcomes in students' perceived learning. Implications for both academics and practitioners are discussed, and suggestions for future research are given.

ID PERSONALITY
AB In the last two decades, game-based learning environments have evolved into powerful learning tools. With the growth and evolution in complexity of these innovations, complementary work in game-based assessment design has also begun to take shape and has generated considerable interest among a variety of education stakeholders. This is in part due to their ability to offer real-time, adaptive and integrated formative feedback. As the use of digital devices and digital learning tools continues to expand in schools, the potential for harnessing learning data becomes increasingly possible and powerful. Yet there are inherent tensions and challenges in the nature of collecting assessment data inside a game-based learning environment which confront our foundational premises of what makes for a good assessment. In this article, we explore the evolution and opportunities of the emerging field of game-based assessment, the challenges and tensions these innovations present and how we may be able to collectively advance this work to benefit everyday classrooms.

ID FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT
AB With advancements in educational technologies, e-learning platforms have evolved to provide learning environments to the privileged and under-privileged population so that they can learn at their own pace. The success of these systems relies on engaging experience and timely and accurate feedback to the students on their performance. Still, these systems suffer from high student dropouts, often due to a lack of personalization in student interactions. While students show different collaborative behavior, i.e., some students are social, and like discussions, while others are self-oriented and do not participate in any collaborative activity, the feedback and interactions with students are generally not customized based on their type of collaborative behavior. This research aims to develop a method that provides adaptive feedback to each student according to their type of collaborative behavior and preferred gamification elements. Two experiments were performed to evaluate the system, and the results show that the system, with adaptive feedback, significantly improved student performance.

AB This paper presents a scoping review of, firstly, how teachers use digital technologies for school-based assessment, and secondly, how these assessment-purposed digital technologies are used in teacher- and student-centred pedagogies. It draws on research about the use of assessment-purposed digital technologies in school settings, published from 2009 to 2019 in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. The findings indicate automated marking and computer- and web-based assessment technologies support established school-based assessment practices, and that game-based and virtual/augmented environments and ePortfolios diversify the modes of assessment and the evidence of learning collected. These technologies improve the efficiency of assessment practices in teacher-centred pedagogies and provide latitude to assess evidence of learning from more diverse modes of engagement in student-centred pedagogies. Current research commonly focuses on validating specific technologies and most commonly relates to automated assessment of closed outcomes within a narrow range of learning areas; these limits indicate opportunities for future research.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of game-based learning (GBL) on students' motivation, engagement and academic performance on an Arabic language grammar course at Ajman University. The study was carried out utilizing a case study of quasi-empirical design. The respondents were 107 learners, grouped into two groups: one empiric group (n = 54) that used the game-based classroom response system; and the other a control group (n = 53) which was instructed using non-game-based methods. The game-based online assessment tool Kahoot! was used as a formative assessment method in the lectures, and a questionnaire was designed to measure motivation and engagement. The findings indicated that there were statistical differences in the benefit of the empiric group between the empiric and the control groups between the groups. Empirical group students showed more improved knowledge of the concepts taught on the Arabic language grammar course, and higher motivation than the students taught using the traditional strategy.

AB Gamification is a new trend in the field of education. The purpose of this work is to investigate the impact of gamification on students' participation and engagement. The study involved primary school students (age 11-12) and focused on the subject domain of English as a second language. The design of the gamification system was based on Self-determination theory (SDT). The Moodle platform was selected as the technical infrastructure for implementing the gamification approach. The aim of the study is also to investigate the effectiveness of the Moodle platform (version 3.0) regarding the implementation of the gamification approach, as well as the usability of the gamified environment for students of age 11-12. The results of the study showed positive findings in terms of improving students' participation as well as the usability of the gamified Moodle platform. However, the design of automated processes for the Moodle platform is recommended, so as to support demanding gamification scenarios.

DE Engagement; Flipped Learning; Higher Education; Gamification in
   Education; Kahoot; Active Learning
AB In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in applying Gamification in Education, which can be defined as the application of game design elements to learning activities. Its purpose is to motivate students by creating an engaging learning experience that can keep students focused on the learning task and its application in the classroom, is still in its emergent stages. Gamification is a great challenge for education, particularly in Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in such a traditional context, as is the case with courses like Management and Administration Business, Finance and Accounting, Marketing and Market Research, Chemistry, Accounting and Administration and Business Communication.
   This paper presents a study, applied in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 academic years, in which the teaching method focuses on a blended learning approach, through the implementation of a flipped classroom model and also through the introduction of online gamification activities such Kahoot! application. Kahoot is a game-based learning platform, used as educational technology that can easily be used for initial, formative and summative assessment of students' knowledge using individual or collaborative team work mode, adding vitality, student engagement, and also meta-cognitive supports to higher education classrooms with limited instructor or student training required. The participants, in the study, were about 3 000 students of 17 different subjects from the aforementioned courses, of the Malaga University and Polytechnic of Porto.

AB The transformations in educational environments due to the immersion of information and communication technologies (ICT) make it necessary to analyze the limits and possibilities of the assessment of the virtual training process. This paper presents an analysis of the meanings of ICT-mediated assessment, establishing what kinds of knowledge are suitable for this type of evaluation, and the challenges and possibilities of virtual tools. For this, we present a systematic review of ICT-mediated evaluation and assessment according to the educational paradigms and their implementation. We highlight that contemporary pedagogical models and their implementation in ICT mediation tools show a trend towards quantitative and summative valuation. The commonly used learning management systems (LMS) include several types of questions oriented to quantitative evaluation, with multiple-choice being the most common. However, new technological approaches like gamification, virtual reality and mobile learning open new assessment possibilities. The ICT educational platforms and new technologies demand new skills for all educational actors, such as digital literacy.

AB This paper presents a first step into the construction of an innovative web-based eLearning platform featuring Learning Analytics and Gamification called ICT-FLAG. The main goal and key decision at this initial stage of the platform development is the search and selection processes of the most suitable software development framework to guide and support the effective construction of the platform. Despite the availability of many architecture and application frameworks for creating web-based systems in the market, only a few are potentially suitable for the specific goals of our eLearning platform. In this paper, we first review existing frameworks in terms of pros and cons considering the characteristics of the project. Then, the search's outcomes go into a selection methodology whose results are presented and discussed, leading us to make a final decision on the software framework that will eventually support an effective development of the ICT-FLAG platform. The research reported in this paper is currently undertaken within the project "Enhancing ICT education through Formative assessment, Learning Analytics and Gamification" (ICT-FLAG) funded by the Spanish Government.

AB Over the past 18 years, a number of large scale reviews of the literature have documented that gender differences in computer attitudes, ability, and use tend to favor males. Since the use of laptops in higher education classrooms is increasing, it is important to examine whether this use is disproportionally advantageous to males and disadvantageous to females. The purpose of this study was to explore gender differences in the use of laptops in higher education classrooms. Two key areas were examined: on-task behaviors (note-taking, academic activities, instant messaging) and off-task behaviors (e-mail, instant messaging, games, movies, distractions). With respect to on-task behaviors, females reported significantly more note-taking and participation in academic laptop-based activities. No gender differences were observed with respect to instant messaging for academic purposes. Regarding off-task behaviors, females were more distracted by their peers' use of laptops than males, whereas males reported that they played significantly more games during class. Recommendations for future research include expanding the breadth of off- and on-task behaviors assessed, exploring the role of teaching strategies, and focusing on learning performance.

AB Today, as more and more people enroll to higher education, educational authorities, and institutions continually need to update their curricula and to find alternative and innovative ways to support the active participation of learners. Student Response Systems (SRSs) have become one of the most common tools used in today's classrooms. Along with the development of technology, several online tools were provided to a sample of teachers in order to conduct an assessment within the classroom environment as an alternative to classic SRSs. "Kahoot!" is one such tool used within the educational setting. The purpose of this study was to reveal the effects of using Kahoot! on preservice teachers' academic achievement, as well as on their retention when Kahoot! was used as a formative assessment tool. This quasi-experimental study was conducted with 91 preservice teachers during the fall semester of the 2019-2020 academic year. Data were collected via three quizzes, a midterm exam, and a retention test. The study's results indicate that the students who were applied paper-based quizzes had higher exam and retention test scores.

AB This paper presents an effort to create a unified model for conducting and assessing undergraduate dissertations, shared by all disciplines involved in computer game development at a Swedish university. Computer game development includes technology-oriented disciplines as well as disciplines with aesthetical traditions. The challenge has been to create a unified process and assessment procedure while maintaining the individual disciplines' academic standards. The unification has been achieved through the development of the Interdisciplinary Dissertation Model - a shared model where the assessment is focused on fundamental academic principles, and there is a clear separation between summative and formative assessment and well-defined interaction loops between examiners, supervisors and students. Examiners from all involved disciplines have regular meetings focusing on creating an interdisciplinary view on the summative assessment of undergraduate dissertations. The model developed has been successful in that it allows for a unified process for disciplines from fundamentally different academic traditions. The quality of the examined dissertations has been evaluated in a national evaluation. The result shows that all participating disciplines meet the requirements from their respective communities. This shows that the proposed model successfully unifies disciplines without sacrificing the quality in any discipline.

DE Bloom's taxonomy; motivation; adaptive assessment
AB The issue of competence assessment in engineering is analyzed in the context of the lack of motivation for learning. The source of this lack of motivation comes from the distribution of high school students. This assignment creates marginalization for a large number of students. Exit from marginalization can be accomplished through additional motivation. This is the responsibility of the competence assessment system. The proposed system is based on Bloom's taxonomy, with the questions being based on Bloom's verbs. It results an adaptive test system where questions are tailored to each individual's level of training. Another condition for generating motivation is to waive the confidentiality of ratings. The main argument is that this confidentiality supports mediocrity. A tonic competition is preferred. The author's experience demonstrates that this kind of competition is possible, especially using the gamefication. There is also the graphical image of the evolution of competence assessed, called the trajectory in the competence field. The results may have very close scores, but nevertheless the assessment can separate the full skills from the insufficient competencies without diminishing the motivating nature of the test itself.

AB Introduction Increasingly, dental education is using digital strategies to deliver teaching; however, not all of these learning materials are engaging and effective. Aim To evaluate the perception and knowledge retention of undergraduate dental students after using two different digital learning tools: quizzes and PDF. Methods Thirty-three students from a Dental School in the United Kingdom took part in the research. They received learning material derived from the Prosthodontic (Kennedy classification) or Paediatric dentistry content (Tooth classification). The same content was delivered in two different formats: quiz game (n = 17) and PDF file (n = 16). The PDF file had ten images and their classifications, whilst the quiz had the same images with a question about the classification, along with alternatives (single best answer). Results All students gave similar performances on the knowledge assessment; however, their perception about the learning material differed. Students using quizzes (88%) agreed that they were fun and an interesting way of learning, while only 37.5% had this opinion about PDF material (p = .002). When using quizzes, learners were more motivated and confident. They would frequently recommend quizzes to other colleagues; however, the use of PDF was not suggested as frequently (p = .039). As a learning strategy, 100% of the students using quizzes wanted more of the same to study other dental subjects. This was not the case with the PDF format (p = .005). Conclusion Despite quizzes and PDF files resulting in a similar understanding of dental subjects, learners prefer quizzes to supplement their studies. Educators should consider using this interactive digital tool to engage students, instead of PDF files.

AB Kahoot! is a game-based learning platform used to review students' knowledge, for formative assessment or as a break from traditional classroom activities. It is among the most popular game-based learning platforms, with 70 million monthly active unique users and used by 50% of US K-12 students. Since the platform was released in 2013, many studies have been published on the effect of using Kahoot! in the classroom, but so far, no systematic analysis of the results. This article presents the results of a literature review on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning and, more specifically, on how Kahoot! affects learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attitudes and perceptions, and students' anxiety. The literature review includes 93 studies, and the main conclusion is that Kahoot! can have a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attitudes, and students' anxiety. However, there are also studies where Kahoot! has little or no effect. The main challenges mentioned by students include technical problems such as unreliable internet connections, hard to read questions and answers on a projected screen, not being able to change answer after submission, stressful time-pressure for giving answers, not enough time to answer, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up if an incorrect answer had been given. Further, the main challenges mentioned by teachers include getting the difficulty level of questions and answers right, problems related to network connectivity, scoring based on how quickly the students answer reducing student reflection and cause some students to guess without thinking, that some students can have a problem with failing a quiz, and some teachers find it challenging to use the technology.

AB The importance of computational thinking (CT) as a 21st-century skill for future generations has been a key consideration in the reforms of many national and regional educational systems. Much attention has been paid to integrating CT into the traditional subject classrooms. This paper describes a scoping review of learning tools for integrating CT and mathematics in current empirical studies published from 2015 to 2021. The review showed that most of the studies implemented CT-intensive Math-connected integration. Five major types of CT tools had been identified, i.e., digital tangibles, apps and games, programming languages, formative or summative assessments, and other technological tools. In many instances, the tools also provide functions of assessment of CT skills. The most assessed CT competencies were including algorithms and algorithmic thinking, abstraction, testing and debugging, loops, and sequences. Geometry and Measurement was the most assessed mathematics topic. Our scoping review is beneficial in the investigation of the literature on CT and mathematics education, as well as guides those who are interested in developing curriculum, programs, or assessments that involve the integration of CT and mathematics.

AB Learning analytics (LA) in educational games is considered an emerging practice due to its potential of enhancing the learning process. Growing research on formative assessment has shed light on the ways in which students' meaningful and in-situ learning experiences can be supported through educational games. To understand learners' playful experiences during gameplay, researchers have applied LA, which focuses on understanding students' in-game behaviour trajectories and personal learning needs during play. However, there is a lack of studies exploring how further research on LA in educational games can be conducted. Only a few analyses have discussed how LA has been designed, integrated, and implemented in educational games. Accordingly, this systematic literature review examined how LA in educational games has evolved. The study findings suggest that: (1) there is an increasing need to consider factors such as student modelling, iterative game design and personalisation when designing and implementing LA through educational games; and (2) the use of LA creates several challenges from technical, data management and ethical perspectives. In addition to outlining these findings, this article offers important notes for practitioners, and discusses the implications of the study's results.

AB Remote teaching emerged as an alternative to face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, teachers adopt formative assessments through different approaches. One of these approaches is Game-based Student Response Systems (GSRS). Kahoot! is a prominent GSRS widely adopted in the educational context. Previous studies investigated the effects and use of Kahoot! by students. Still, none of them reports the teachers' perception of its Usability and User Experience (UX), attributes that influence the tool's adoption. This paper presents the usability and UX evaluation of Kahoot! from the point of view of teachers and students. To comparatively visualize the difference in the experience of the two profiles of platform users, we included five students and five teachers in the study. The evaluation results showed that teachers were more dissatisfied, although the positive and negative emotions were similar for the two profiles. We then conducted interviews with the teachers to understand the motives behind their dissatisfaction. The interviews helped us determine which aspects related to usability and UX teachers perceived as critical during the use of Kahoot!.

AB This paper describes the evaluation of a computer game to support triage training. Triage is a process for decision-making that prioritises mass casualties in terms of treatment. The main aim of the research was to test the hypothesis that participants using the game for practice would perform better in terms of the accuracy in applying the triage protocol than a group that practised triage with a table-top exercise. The method of giving in-game formative feedback to the learner was modified within the trial programme and that provided the opportunity to investigate whether changing the complexity and timing of feedback affected learning transfer through performance measured in a realistic assessment activity. The results showed that the participants who practised using the game were significantly more accurate for certain measures of performance in applying the triage protocol. The participants that received a modified in-game feedback that reduced complexity and the delay in giving feedback were also significantly more accurate for certain measures of performance in triaging the casualties. These findings will require further experimentation to determine which attributes of the in-game feedback have the greatest impact on the learning of the triage protocol for the given learner group.

AB Learn2Mine is a cloud-based environment developed to support the teaching of data science. This paper discusses the architecture of Learn2Mine, the research that guided its development, and the pilot implementation and formative assessment of its use in teaching data science. Learn2Mine was pilot-tested in Fall 2013 in an introductory data science source. At the end of the term, a survey of students concerning their experiences with the environment was conducted. Quantitative analysis of survey data showed that student opinion about the usefulness of the tool for learning course content was positive. Through open-ended comments, students provided constructive feedback on how the system might be improved. To collect expert opinion on both the didactic and usability aspects of the Learn2Mine system, a number of experts were enlisted to try the system. Experts responded to a survey regarding criteria typically expected of instructional software, such as system usability and flexibility, as well as accuracy and organization of content. Overall, the responses from experts were extremely positive. A plan for further development of the system, based on these results, is presented along with information on the developers' plans for making the environment available for use at other institutions.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic forced teachers worldwide to shift to emergency remote teaching (i.e., virtual teaching). As teachers return to their classrooms for in-person teaching, there is a need to examine how remote teaching influences teachers' instruction. This study examined teachers' use of digital technologies and specific mathematics activities both during remote teaching and during in-person teaching after returning to their classrooms. The study also examined how teacher participants reported how the pandemic influenced their mathematics teaching. Data analysis indicated statistically significant differences in the frequency of use of all digital technologies except for mathematics games, meaning that mathematics games are used now as much during in-person teaching as remote teaching. Teacher participants also reported that the largest influences of the pandemic and remote teaching have had on their in-person mathematics teaching was the use of general, non-mathematics specific technologies to support organization, the use of hands-on or virtual manipulatives, and the benefit of formative assessment. Implications for future research include the need to examine teachers' use of digital technologies and mathematics activities more closely during in-person teaching and leverage interviews as a possible way to more closely study teachers' experiences.

AB Using competitions to motivate students is a well-known practice that has proved to be successful. Nevertheless, grading students only through their results in the competition could unfairly limit the range of grades that each student can get: regardless of the quality of the different teams participating, one student must necessarily win the tournament, another must be second, and so on until the last place. In fact, player rankings are relative assessments that are conditioned by the performance of every student. In this paper, we propose solving this issue by making students do a code review before betting on the competition. By betting, the grade of students depends both on the performance of their own solution and the one they bet on. This way, grades represent not only coding skills, but also code analysis skills, widening the attainable range of grades and allowing for a fairer grade distribution. As a result, students that are not so proficient in coding are rewarded if they demonstrate they can do a good analysis of the source code written by others, which is a very valuable skill in the professional world. We provide a case study in an undergraduate course, showing positive results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we describe the structure, development, and validation process of customized pedagogical kits (CPKs) for differentiated instruction (DI) in chemistry. The CPKs rely on the DI approach, comprising varied pedagogical activities (e.g., games, inquiry activities, puzzles, simulations, models) designed as treatments, to help chemistry teachers personalize their teaching according to students' misconceptions. The kits are based on the response to intervention (RTI) model, where the teacher applies an ongoing evaluation to meet the individual student's needs within an evolutionary flexible process of learning. Each kit includes a diagnostic task, its characterization, pedagogical treatments for diagnosed misconceptions, and an assessment task, to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments implemented in the classroom. The kits are developed along relevant literature criteria for using DI strategies and are based on constant validation and ongoing assessment, as demonstrated in the Redox-reaction CPK development. The validation and impact of the CPK on students' achievements are supported by 25 chemistry teachers that implemented the full kit in their classrooms. Furthermore, the CPKs developed in the present research have succeeded in resolving many of the difficulties and challenges mentioned in the literature as obstructing the implementation of DI.

AB While some gaming portals provide learning-based games, most of them either merely showcase games without offering any function for user feedback for the developers or do not provide open access to individual developers, even if a website has functions for data collection. Therefore, it is difficult for individual developers and small independent teams to obtain user feedback for making enhancements in their games in the prototyping phase. The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate an open online platform system to host mathematical thinking games. Through a joint research project in collaboration with the University of Tokyo and Benesse Corporation, we have developed the 'Global Math' platform, which is an open online platform to host mathematical thinking games for Indie game developers and students interested in developing learning games. The platform features the 'Global Math API', which enables game developers to obtain play log data by simply registering and embedding certain JavaScript codes. The API offers an interface that stores play log data in the Global Math platform database. The platform offers data-analytic functions to monitor how the games are played and received by audiences. As a formative assessment of the platform in terms of usability and effectiveness, four teams of undergraduate students who study game design participated in a game design project using the platform. The teams worked on the project for two months and uploaded four game prototypes successfully. The survey findings indicate that the students found that this project offered them an opportunity to think about different aspects of game design that they had not considered previously, and they found it appealing to develop mathematical learning games. It showed that developing mathematical games can be engaging for students as long as they are provided with the necessary resources. The survey also indicates that more instructional and technical support for developers is necessary to use the functions of the platform.

AB Introduction: The struggle to maintain quality education in the online environment has brought about the redesign for the family nurse practitioner courses.
   Background: The family nurse practitioner program uses graduate Health Education Systems Incorporated examination as a quality indicator and program benchmark. A downward trend in Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores stimulated a need for change. Two strategies were implemented to enhance engagement and improve synthesis of clinical information. Case-based learning and gamification involves the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems while the case-based discussions act as formative assessment tool, providing information on student's progress and development.
   Objectives: To assess the implementation of innovative strategies on the Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores and to enhance students engagement and synthesis of clinical information.
   Method: Case presentations were created in the Learning Management System an online program, for every module. Interwoven throughout the module are various game elements. The game elements include voluntary participation with immediate feedback that can be both positive and negative and provides a social connection. The student has the freedom to fail and the freedom to choose without significant repercussions.
   Results: The results showed examination scores increased significantly. Using a one-way analysis of variance to compare Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores between semester cohorts of students, followed by a post hoc pairwise comparison a statistically significant difference (p < .001) between previous semesters was identified.
   Conclusion: Although there are many approaches for online learning, using case presentations can mirror different social and cultural situations to challenge the learner. Case-based discussion and gamification strategies are effective in engaging students in a challenging environment. Student responded positively to case-base presentation with game elements. Using this approach is designed to challenge and add value to the learning experience.

AB In higher education, one commonly used teaching approach that is intended to develop deep learning is that of the 'Oxford' tutorial-a personalized Socratic approach in which an instructor discusses course-related issues with a handful of students. Even though this conventional tutorial model is well supported in the literature, it may be neglected by research-driven academics and is expensive to operate. The latter issue has placed tutorials in the spotlight because higher education institutions are facing huge funding cuts worldwide. In light of these problems, a scoping review was conducted to explore financially viable alternatives to the Oxford tutorial for management education. Articles in highly ranked management education and development academic journals were collected by searching these catalogs and compiling a database of 48 articles published in four premier journals. These articles were reviewed by two independent raters in order to arrive at 8 alternatives to the Oxford tutorial model that can achieve similar objectives of said tutorials while reducing costs. These alternative tutorial models all involve the application of information communication technologies to tutorials and include peer instruction, simulations and games, online collaborative learning, syndicates, flipped classrooms, communication systems, tailored learning, and portfolios. Challenges and implementation guidelines are explained for each alternative tutorial model.

AB Y It is widely accepted that the digital game-based learning approach has the advantage of stimulating students' learning motivation, but simply using digital games in the classroom does not guarantee satisfactory learning achievement, especially in the case of the absence of a teacher. Integrating appropriate learning strategies into a game can better enhance the learning performance. Therefore, in this study, a mastery theory-based digital game with different feedback models was developed to compare the differences in the learning behavior of students using the two feedback models. Lag sequential analysis was then applied to identify the sequential behaviors that are statistically proven to have impact. The results of the experiments and behavior analysis show that, with proper design of the game, students in both feedback methods can achieve the same learning performance as that in the conventional learning method with a teacher involved. Moreover, students in the Regular Feedback Group reviewed the learning material more times than those in the Corrective Feedback Group, which seemed to mitigate the drawbacks of the regular feedback. This result suggests that a proper game design will be able to achieve effective learning and is robust in terms of feedback models.

AB E-learning has been an important learning approach in the information era by providing flexible environments and rich resources for learners. However, it also faces several challenges, the biggest one being that students need to have strong self-regulation competence to control and manage their e-learning. As gamification has been widely used in primary education to facilitate children's learning motivation and engagement, it is valuable to explore the impacts of gamification on children's self-regulated learning. In this study, the role of gamification in children's English learning in Hong Kong was investigated through a gamified e-learning system. A quasi-experiment with pre-test/post-test design was conducted among primary level 3 students over a semester. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through academic tests, questionnaires, and interviews to provide comprehensive insights into the research questions. The key findings enable the identification of: (1) students' gaining of self-regulated learning interest and academic performance from the gamified learning system; (2) students' developed self-regulated learning strategies; and (3) the connection between gamification and students' self-regulated learning. These findings have implications for e-learning designers and educators with regards to the practice of gamified learning to enhance students' self-regulated learning and second language learning.

AB This Innovation Practice Category Work-in-Progress Paper presents the implementation and results of a blended learning approach to design an introductory Power System Course to enhance student learning and pique their interest. The focus of this research is to develop a blended learning framework that converts the student from a passive listener to an active learner. Firstly, the lectures were moved online but instead of covering one topic and all the sub-topics in one video we covered each sub-topic in a separate video. This resulted in four to five videos a week between five to ten minutes. The shorter videos ensure that students learn the individual sub-topics before their attention gets divided. The classroom time was spent in relating the theory taught in the videos to practical real-life applications, live demonstrations of the concepts as well as solving mathematical tutorials. Secondly, a graded online quiz is conducted every two or three weeks that tests students on the video's contents. Thirdly, quizzes with a competitive element built in are conducted during the classroom time to revise and reiterate the concepts covered that week. Quantitative and qualitative analysis show promising results on the implementation of blended learning in power systems.

AB Building on the promise shown in game-based learning research, this paper explores methods for Game Based Learning Assessments (GBLA) using a variety of educational data mining techniques (EDM). GBLA research examines patterns of behaviors evident in game data logs for the measurement of implicit learning-the development of unarticulated knowledge that is not yet expressible on a test or formal assessment. This paper reports on the study of two digital games showing how the combination of human coding with EDM has enabled researchers to measure implicit learning of Physics. In the game Impulse, researchers combined human coding of video with educational data mining to create a set of automated detectors of students' implicit understanding of Newtonian mechanics. For Quantum Spectre, an optics puzzle game, human coding of Interaction Networks was used to identify common student errors. Findings show that several of our measures of student implicit learning within these games were significantly correlated with improvements in external postassessments. Methods and detailed findings were different for each type of game. These results suggest GBLA shows promise for future work such as adaptive games and in-class, data-driven formative assessments, but design of the assessment mechanics must be carefully crafted for each game.

AB There is a shift in education towards adopting pedagogical approaches that nurture deeper learning. Educators recognise that effective and active approaches to teaching are more closely associated with deeper learning. These active approaches aim to develop higher order skills, encouraging learners' critical thinking and decision-making as well as enhancing their capacity to be agile, flexible and adaptable. Among those active approaches stand serious games, which are powerful learning environments that are seen as an emergent and engaging new way of experiment situations and construct knowledge. Serious games, in the form of role-play simulations, are scenario-based games that are used to simulate real life situations. Although serious games and simulations have been widely used in serving educational purposes, there is little evidence on their use in achieving deeper learning. In addition, there is lack of guidelines or a framework for designing serious games to support learners achieve deep learning. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, based on Bloom's educational model for Mastery Learning, which illustrates the design of instructional process adapted for serious games using empathy and creativity as an approach of designing serious games for achieving deeper learning. It describes an approach of evaluating this framework by designing a serious game focusing on raising awareness about domestic violence and abuse.

AB Purpose This study aims to assess students' learning performance and perceived need satisfaction between a gamified flipped classroom (GFC) and flipped classroom (FC) instruction in a low-tech setting. The iSpring Learn learning management system was used as a low-tech gamification application in gamifying the flipped learning class. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was used for collecting the data. Three formative assessments were used to examine students' learning performance during the intervention period, and a post-questionnaire survey was used to support the data collection process with regard to students' perceived needs satisfaction. In total, 56 students were involved in a non-randomised experiment with a control group design. Findings The results reveal that Assessment 1 showed no significant difference between the two intervention groups (p > 0.05), while Assessments 2 and 3 were significantly different (p < 0.05). The survey results confirm that participants in the GFC have achieved a great level of motivation because their innate psychological needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness are satisfied. Originality/value Gamification as a current concept of a twenty-first-century instructional skill has proven to be remarkably influential. This study suggests that the FC and gamification concept might be possibly implemented in a low-tech information environment - without the required advanced technology platform.

AB This paper presents ongoing research aimed at improving building sustainability education through the use of serious games. With the growth of the population worldwide and the increased demand on resources, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable buildings. As architects, engineers and construction professionals are educated for the future, the complex area of building sustainability must be included in the curriculum; however, the literature shows no clear consensus on teaching methods or curriculum design. Growing evidence suggests that computer games could be effective tools in construction education as they can provide students with both theoretical and applied knowledge. In this paper we describe the development and initial evaluation of a serious game for learning sustainable building design principles and practices. The game is aimed at undergraduate students enrolled in Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Construction Management programs. Findings from a formative study with 17 students and three faculty show that the game was perceived as usable, engaging and useful for learning/teaching building sustainability. Results of a summative study with 42 undergraduate students show that playing the game led to an increase in subjects' declarative knowledge by 22% and procedural knowledge by 37%. Compared with traditional learning methods, playing the game led to significantly higher procedural knowledge gains, whereas gains in declarative knowledge were not significantly higher.

AB This paper presents the findings of a study of Game-Based Learning (GBL) practitioners (N=12). The practitioners, who were a mix of academics, researchers and industry practitioners with experience of GBL research and / or implementation, were asked open questions in a survey about the effectiveness of GBL, the benefits that virtual reality (VR) bring to GBL, how the use of learning analytics dashboards (LADs) can help learner and educator, the mapping of learner interactions to taxonomies of learning, and whether universal design should be embedded at the heart of GBL. The questions also addressed the process by which GBL solutions are developed, with a focus on iterative prototyping and how GBL analytics can assist in the formative evaluation of a GBL solution when combined (triangulated) with other approaches (such as observations of learners playing a GBL solution). To assist the respondents, a case study was presented in the form of a game play video (of a VR-based GBL solution that teaches graph theory) with commentary by the GBL developer along with screenshots of learning analytics visualizations from a study of learners (N=20) carried out by the author.
   A thematic analysis was carried out on the responses. On a question by question basis, meaning units were identified and categorized, and the categories were organised into themes. This led to several findings per question. The findings include: GBL is effective, but must be well designed; VR is an exciting, largely unexplored medium with many positive pedagogical benefits, but it has disadvantages such as cost and inaccessibility; LADs assist learners to be more autonomous and help with their executive functions, but they need to be carefully designed with actionable information and need to use visual aids to help comprehension; mapping learner interactions to a taxonomy (for the purpose of visualization) can support learners' executive functions, such as assessing performance and progress, and setting goals - the gathering of learner interaction data has potential for automating the prediction of learner performance, which could lead to earlier intervention; an iterative approach to GBL development allows for greater inclusion of stakeholders, continuous improvement and more complex solutions - this agile approach in GBL development is under way and following the lead of other industries; using visualizations as part of formative evaluation can identify issues of usability, flow and balance, as well as measuring effectiveness; the practitioners agreed that universal design should be embedded at the heart of any model for GBL design and development, but were largely unaware of specific frameworks for universal design in education, such as the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework; when evaluating GBL solutions, a mixed methods approach was seen as best practice with triangulation then becoming possible to identify more complex issues.
   The findings of the practitioner study will be of interest to all designers and developers of GBL solutions. They provide guidance on many aspects of modern GBL, such as the benefits of VR, the use of agile development processes, the integration of learning analytics, and mixed methods evaluation that allows for triangulation of findings from multiple datasets.

AB Research has demonstrated the positive impact of active learning on students' learning outcomes, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, few studies have explored the impact of active learning via problem-based collaborative games in large mathematics classes in the context of Asian tertiary education. This study assesses the effects of active learning on students' learning outcomes using class test scores and the calculus concept inventory (CCI) to test the conceptual understanding of the basic principles of differential calculus, in a first year calculus course in Hong Kong. Three hypotheses were tested to determine the effects of game-based collaborative learning on learning mathematics among students. Active learning through a problem-based collaborative learning methodology was employed, using Kahoot!, a game-based learning platform. Results supported all three hypotheses, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in students' conceptual understanding and examination performance, based upon their individual perceptions of active engagement and time spent in active learning. Our results indicated that active learning "levels the playing field", in the sense that students with less pre-requisite background knowledge, using a problem-based collaborative learning methodology, were relatively more inclined to catch up or even exceed the performance of students with a stronger prerequisite background knowledge, at the end of the course.

AB The aim of this paper is to look at the use of gaming in language learning environments, particularly within Cardiff University's innovative Languages for All programme.
   Kahoot! describes itself as a "free game-based learning platform that makes it fun to learn - any subject, in any language, on any device, for all ages!" As the use of digital technology (and in particular gaming) continues to increase in teaching methodology, there also seems to be an equivalent requirement to provide real time feedback to students. Student feedback is high on the agenda of many Universities' strategic plans, as it is a key indicator of their performance. It is measured on the National Student Survey (NSS) and is a fundamental factor in enriching students' experience.
   This paper will examine how gaming can invigorate learning, engage students, improve student feedback, encourage participation from less confident students, and how it can be an excellent way of formative assessment and for immediate feedback in language learning. It will look at how student motivations have developed, and what lessons could be learnt for the future of language learning in an increasingly digital age.
   In a study provided by the Kahoot! Journal, it reported: "students that did the game-based quiz (Kahoot!), learned 22% more than students that did paper quizzes, and 52% more than students that used the student-response system Clickers." Furthermore, the results showed that "students that used Kahoot! were 25% more motivated by the quiz compared to the paper quiz, and 21% more motivated than students using the non-game student-response system."
   Languages for All and the School of Modern Languages at Cardiff University has piloted the use of Kahoot! and Poll Everywhere in classrooms using a variety of different pedagogical approaches. This has included for "ice breaking" exercises, consolidation of learning, fun and competitive quizzing, through to formal and summative assessment. The positive impact on teaching and learning and the excellent feedback from students has helped to support the belief that gaming can be an effective tool for language learning.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; FEEDBACK
AB 16% of first-year students did not progress in 3rd level education in Ireland in 2013-14. It was noted that academic performance and confidence affect students' progression. We speculate that students should internalise assessment standards and criteria to gauge their progress, what will improve their performance and confidence. To internalise these standards students will simulate lecturers' processes, specifically grading and feedback creation, by using peer review. They will apply standards to evaluate and enhance submissions from fellow students and themselves. Through the frequent use of peer review, students will develop an understanding of a quality and an ability to judge work similarly to experienced teachers. To make a peer review system engaging to users, we use gamification - "the use of game elements in a non-game context". This leads us to the research question - "How effective is gamification in engaging students to internalise standards compared to standard peer review?". The gamified system was developed using User-Centred Design. We have a non-gamified version of the peer review complete. At its core, the peer review system is a group evaluation of submitted work, which employs analytical abilities and tends to be repetitive when used constantly. We ran paper prototype tests with different game elements. Based on the feedback from a test group, we needed to add an element of fun and sense of progression. We included progression elements (levels and XP for reviewers and a progress bar for the submission evaluation) to add the sense of improving for peer reviewers, social elements (teamwork and competition) to develop the team atmosphere and competition with other peer review teams, adding an element of fun. A pilot study was conducted on the research students to identify changes needed. The finalised systems, both gamified and non-gamified, will be deployed as a web service and will be used to answer the research question. To derive results, we plan to conduct semi-structured interviews, measure time spent in the system and level achieved, as well as ask students and lecturers to produce a review and compare them.

AB The results obtained thanks to the flipped classroom with 'just Iiin time' teaching method are reviewed. This method allowed to know what the students did not understand after trying to study the instructive materials assigned to them. To achieve that the students work before class methods of marketing and gamification were developed. Methods for the analysis of student responses were also developed. The JiTT method allowes the teacher know in advance those aspects that are most interesting or most dificult to understand for the students as well as their most urgent doubts. Finally, we have developed methods to use the urgent doubts of the students to generate formative feedback and activities to do in the classroom. In the method named "flipped learning forte" the teacher answer the urgent doubts of his students. In the method named 'flip in colours' the teacher classify the doubts by their posible utility in the classroom using a color code. With the combined application of these methods in university courses the failure rate of the students has decreased and the mean grade in the exams for the assessment of learning has increased in more than one standard deviation. The rate of students that attain the level of mastery has increased, as well as the student evaluations about the teachers of these courses. Finally, the reasons underlying the efficacy of the proposed flipped method are discussed.

DE game-based learning; motivation; mobile; gamification; design
AB This paper evaluates the development of a videogame-like mobile app designed to enhance student experience using gamification principles. An approach is taken that attempts to avoid any reduction in intrinsic motivation and minimises subject specific content, while increasing the range of video game design principles beyond that normally found in educational gamification projects. Gamification that relies on points and leader boards to motivate can miss the essence of engaging video game design. The most popular video games use a wide range of game design principles to create a fun and motivating experience, something that is often missed in gamification. A non-educational 3D video game is used to motivate students to engage with the app, without being subject specific. However, making progress within the video game requires students to earn virtual credits by attending classes, engaging with class activities and handing in assessments. The game uses virtual avatars, currency and upgrades which motivate students to engage with the application while avoiding the need for real-world rewards. Asynchronous multiplayer allows students to work together within the game and share the experience as a group within class. This enables a form of competition that is less likely to demonstrate negative side effects, yet is still compulsive. An innovative game design was used that is based on recent 'one-button' mobile games. The design allows the app to attract and hold the student's interest without taking excessive amounts of time away from their studies, as it can be played in an interactive or non-interactive mode. In-app metrics, surveys and interviews were used to develop case studies of three of the students in the study. This gives an insight into the different motivations and styles of interaction that students exhibited with the app. By removing access to the embedded game part way through the experiment it was shown that the game provided a significant motivational element of the overall gamification app. Although the students did not report any negative impact on their intrinsic motivation or enjoyment of the class, cheating was detected as students attempted to maximise their progress within the embedded game.

AB In this paper, we describe the preliminary ways in which we have extended our mobile system, QUBED, an in-house Multiple Choice System, which is used to encourage students to build a question bank of multiple choice questions (MCQ) that will be used by their peers. They will be able to build questions and set quizzes that will be taken and rated by other classmates. As their usage increases they are awarded various 'points' for the way in which they interact with the system. These points are 'rewards' for participating in building and enhancing the social capital held within the system. The system monitors student engagement and maintains a leader-board of activities so all students can see how they compare with their peers. It is envisioned that this will add a useful competitive edge to the usage of the system as it should have an effect on how a person is viewed by others in the group, and is likely to help enhance their productivity, wellbeing and self-image.
   The introduction of the leader-board scenario from games playing will be explored to assess the usefulness and appeal of using such a tool in a learning environment. Case studies in the commercial sector have shown that the concept of gamification can have a positive impact on engagement. EMC2 embarked on a drive to increase customer participation resulting in the development of their Recognition, Awards and Motivation Program (RAMPS). The program had the desired effect; resulting in increased interaction between the company and its customers. Likewise Deloitte applied a similar approach to their Leadership Academy; including ranking, rewards, missions, and leader-boards achieving improved participation rates and, equally interesting, improved participant returns and retention rates. Ultimately we are interested in the student's ability to learn and not just how well they have used the system so the emphasis is still based on the formative feedback aspects of the original system.

AB While previous studies have stressed the importance of feedback delivered by experts, it is unclear whether students' oral presentation competence can be fostered through innovative technology for delivering feedback. This experimental study examined the effectiveness of a virtual reality-based task, in which first-year undergraduate students practiced their presentation in a virtual environment and received feedback produced by the system, on their presentation competence components (i.e. cognition, behaviour and attitudes towards presenting). The effects were compared with a control condition, which was a face-to-face presentation task with expert feedback. The students' performance was measured using pre- and post-test multiple-choice tests, validated rubrics, and self-evaluation instruments. Results revealed significant improvements from pre-test to post-test in all three presentation competence components, without a difference between the conditions. Furthermore, the self-evaluation tests showed that students who presented in virtual reality were appreciative of the detailed and analytical feedback they received. Because of sample size limitations, the effects found could not be generalised. Therefore, future research on a larger sample is needed to examine population effects. Follow-up studies should focus on the extent to which virtual reality-based tasks can encourage self-regulation skills for the effective and efficient integration of these tasks in presentation courses.

AB This paper focused on the effectiveness of Kahoot, a game-based student response system, as a revision tool in studying waves. There were sixty-six G12 student participants from an all-boys school in Metro Manila Philippines. The students were all enrolled in SY 2016-2017 and came from different K-12 strands: Science Technology, engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Business, Administration and Management (BAM) and Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS). The students were grouped into two, one section (group A) used Kahoot during their revision in waves while the other group (group B) used the common way of revision in which teacher projects the items on the screen and wait for the students to answer each question. Both group of students had the same number of sessions and number of formative assessments in waves. Results showed that there is a significant difference in students' performance in terms of their summative test grades. Group A, who used Kahoot got a significantly higher summative test grades than Group B. In terms of students' perception with the use of Kahoot as a revision tool in studying waves, results showed that most students: 1) had fun during the game; 2) agree that they learned something from the game; 3) said that they will recommend the game; and 4) felt positive after the game. Results also revealed that the performance of the students in the summative test is largely associated with their perception of learning and feeling.

AB This article discusses the effects of simulation games in the education of students and the skills and abilities that they obtained after participating in discipline-based on the online or outline simulation programs. These applications may be individual or components software of e-learning platforms. Games-based learning has captured the interest of educationalists and industrialists who seek to exploit the characteristics of computer games as they are perceived by some to be a potentially effective approach for teaching and learning. The type of the activity to the students in enhancing cooperation and constructing higher responsibility is games. A simple game can be able to improve cooperation and social ability of the member; to practice communication; and to improve emotional management. One more this simulation games can development leadership style of the participants. This research shows a link between the effects of simulation programs and performance of the simulation game. Simulating various aspects of professional environment and real industrial processes, allows to train students apply the obtained theoretical knowledge and solve problems emerging in their professional activity. For the design of educational games, the results suggest that the challenge of the game should be able to keep up with the learners growing abilities and learning in order to endorse continued learning in game-based learning environments. The link between students developmental (formative) assessment opportunities over the course of the simulation, explaining assessment criteria and ways that students can improve their performance, requiring students to undertake reflection on their learning and outcomes, and ensuring that higher order thinking skills are engaged.

AB Serious games are games with an educational purpose. In these games, players develop their skills by facing a number of challenges, and students are assessed according to their game playing behaviour. Assessment of serious game-based learning experiences has to take into account diverse features as game genre, pedagogical aim or game context. This paper analyses how skills are usually assessed in learning experiences based on serious games. To reach this objective, a systematic mapping study of more than 400 papers is undertaken. Papers were identified and classified according to a framework based on four categories: assessment aim, implementation, integration and primary assessment type. The reviewed literature mainly deals with contributions on methods and approaches for serious games. Results have revealed that most assessment methods are applied for a formative purpose more than for a certification purpose. Most frequent implementations such as game scoring and integrations like monitoring states were also uncovered. The main primary type of assessment detected was in-process. In addition, several limitations were found in the assessment methods: regarding the aim of assessment, certification of previous or attained skills was usually implemented out of the game; the scope of some implementations was limited because results were predefined earlier; and most of methods analysed present scalability issues because they rely on manual assessments. Such findings are analysed and discussed to clarify the state of the art and provide recommendations for further work in the area of serious games-based learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Higher education students have positive attitudes about the use of audience response systems (ARS), but even technology-enhanced lessons can become tiresome if the pedagogical approach is exactly the same with each implementation. Gamification is the notion that gaming mechanics can be applied to routine activities. In this study, TurningPoint (TP) ARS interactions were gamified and implemented in 22 large group medical microbiology lectures throughout an integrated year 1 osteopathic medical school curriculum.
   Methods: A 32-item questionnaire was used to measure students' perceptions of the gamified TP interactions at the end of their first year. The survey instrument generated both Likert scale and open-ended response data that addressed game design and variety, engagement and learning features, use of TP questions after class, and any value of lecture capture technology for reviewing these interactive presentations. The Chi Square Test was used to analyze grouped responses to Likert scale questions. Responses to open-ended prompts were categorized using open-coding.
   Results: Ninety-one students out of 106 (86 %) responded to the survey. A significant majority of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the games were engaging, and an effective learning tool. The questionnaire investigated the degree to which specific features of these interactions were engaging (nine items) and promoted learning (seven items). The most highly ranked engagement aspects were peer competition and focus on the activity (tied for highest ranking), and the most highly ranked learning aspect was applying theoretical knowledge to clinical scenarios. Another notable item was the variety of interactions, which ranked in the top three in both the engagement and learning categories. Open-ended comments shed light on how students use TP questions for exam preparation, and revealed engaging and non-engaging attributes of these interactive sessions for students who review them via lecture capture.
   Conclusions: Students clearly valued the engagement and learning aspects of gamified TP interactions. The overwhelming majority of students surveyed in this study were engaged by the variety of TP games, and gained an interest in microbiology. The methods described in this study may be useful for other educators wishing to expand the utility of ARS in their classrooms.

AB In fall 2011 our learning game "Ludwig" will be released. It is funded by the Austrian Ministry of Science in course of the educational projects "Sparkling Science" and "Departure". "Ludwig" is a 3D-adventure on renewable energies set in a sci-fi context reminiscent of today's blockbuster games. The content of the game is based on the physics curriculum (two physics didacts are involved). The learning progress in our game is mapped by knowledge points, which are received when important quests are solved or if resources are found by the player. The more he or she explores the virtual world the more content is unlocked in the knowledge base. It describes important facts related to energy (combustion, wind energy, solar energy). These facts orient on educational standards for physics. Concerning the design of our knowledge base, important usability criteria (based on national DIN norms) are taken into consideration. Our project involves students and teachers from the very beginning (conceptional stage). Students reflect on the playability of our game, on the usability of our knowledge base (representing the content) and on motivational aspects (learning motivation, interest for physics). Teachers reflect on the potential benefits and problems of using "Ludwig" in class. The methodology is both qualitative and quantitative. While quantitative methods make use of numbers to precisely operationalize values of a particular variable (answers in questionnaires) for further statistical computations, qualitative methods allow for a systematic interpretation of verbal material (interviews, workshops). The empirical phase of our project encompasses elements of a formative (quality assurance workshops) as well as a summative evaluation (assessment of motivational, cognitive and learning processes). By taking this multi-method approach we aim at the development of a standardized method for evaluating future game based learning projects.

AB This article examines empirically the impact of students' critical feedback choices on their memory for feedback. It also examines the effect of choosing versus receiving feedback on learning outcomes. First, a correlational study was designed to collect the choices to seek critical feedback and to revise posters from a hundred and six Grade 8 middle-school students via Posterlet, a digital assessment game in which students design posters. Upon completing the game, students filled a post-test asking them to freely recall the feedback messages they encountered in Posterlet. Results show that, when they have a choice between critical and confirmatory feedback, students tend to remember critical feedback better than confirmatory feedback. Second, a yoked experiment was designed to compare the performance and learning of college students who chose and were assigned the same amount and order of critical feedback, respectively. Results show that 1) critical feedback and revision are positively associated with performance when students choose their feedback, while critical feedback is negatively associated with learning when students receive their feedback; 2) students who engaged with higher levels of critical feedback significantly outperformed the rest of the participants only if they had a choice over their feedback; and 3) students enjoy designing posters significantly more when they choose rather than receive their feedback. Ramifications for student learning are discussed. Future work will examine whether there are any differences in memory for feedback between students who choose and those who are assigned the same amount and order of critical feedback.

AB The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the intellectual structure of the research on educational technology in science education (ETiSE) within the most recent years (2008-2013). Based on the criteria for educational technology research and the citation threshold for educational co-citation analysis, a total of 137 relevant ETiSE papers were identified from the International Journal of Science Education, the Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Science Education, and the Journal of Science Education and Technology. Then, a series of methodologies were performed to analyze all 137 source documents, including document co-citation analysis, social network analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. As a result, 454 co-citation ties were obtained and then graphically visualized with an undirected network, presenting a global structure of the current ETiSE research network. In addition, four major underlying intellectual subfields within the main component of the ETiSE network were extracted and named as: (1) technology-enhanced science inquiry, (2) simulation and visualization for understanding, (3) technology-enhanced chemistry learning, and (4) game-based science learning. The most influential co-citation pairs and cross-boundary phenomena were then analyzed and visualized in a co-citation network. This is the very first attempt to illuminate the core ideas underlying ETiSE research by integrating the co-citation method, factor analysis, and the networking visualization technique. The findings of this study provide a platform for scholarly discussion of the dissemination and research trends within the current ETiSE literature.

AB Predicting student performance as early as possible and analysing to which extent initial student behaviour could lead to failure or success is critical in introductory programming (CS1) courses, for allowing prompt intervention in a move towards alleviating their high failure rate. However, in CS1 performance prediction, there is a serious lack of studies that interpret the predictive model's decisions. In this sense, we designed a long-term study using very fine-grained log-data of 2056 students, collected from the first two weeks of CS1 courses. We extract features that measure how students deal with deadlines, how they fix errors, how much time they spend programming, and so forth. Subsequently, we construct a predictive model that achieved cutting-edge results with area under the curve (AUC) of.89, and an average accuracy of 81.3%. To allow an effective intervention and to facilitate human-AI collaboration towards prescriptive analytics, we, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, go a step further than the prediction itself and leverage this field by proposing an approach to explaining our predictive model decisions individually and collectively using a game-theory based framework (SHAP), (Lundberg et al., 2020) that allows interpreting our black-box non-linear model linearly. In other words, we explain the feature effects, clearly by visualising and analysing individual predictions, the overall importance of features, and identification of typical prediction paths. This method can be further applied to other emerging competitive models, as the CS1 prediction field progresses, ensuring transparency of the process for key stakeholders: administrators, teachers, and students.

AB This article relates to a series of trials to assess the value of games of the Team-based Mixed-reality (TBMR) type, a term used to denote games involving participants working in small teams to make periodic decisions in relation to a real life scenario. A game was specifically developed to represent the TBMR genre and assessed using students taking a module in the Management of Innovation. Some two hundred pre-and post-tests were conducted, to capture both qualitative and quantitative data. In the former, the students' perception of the value of the game was assessed and in the latter case, the actual learning which took place. The results were analysed both by the improvement in the scores achieved and by the percentage of students giving the correct answer. The findings showed that the perceived educational value of the game was very positive; also in terms of motivation towards the subject and in comparison to a traditional lesson. The results relating to actual educational improvement showed a slight increase in both knowledge and decision-making ability overall, but there was a significant difference when split between Chinese students and others. The rationale for the game design and development process is also detailed, with reference to the findings of others researching game design and considerations given to scope, level of challenge, alignment to the module, the contribution of teamwork and feedback. An analysis of each of the specific test questions revealed a wide variation in results and lessons were learned as to which particular topics enhance learning the most, thus pointing to improvements in reshaping the game for future use.

AB This is a pilot study aimed at examining students' learning performance and perceived motivation between a gamified flipped classroom and a non-gamified flipped classroom instructional model, based on the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). This study employed a mixed-method research approach, using three formative assessments or a post-test only design to examine students' learning achievement. Questionnaires and personal interviews were employed to support the data collection process in terms of students' perceived motivation. Fifty-six students were the respondents involved in a non-randomized experiment with a control group design. The results reveal that assessment 1 showed no significant difference between the two groups of the gamified flipped and non-gamified flipped classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p.474), while assessment 2 and 3 were significantly different (t = 5.54, p = .007 < .05) and (t = 10.17, p = .001 < .05). In the present study, the findings confirm that the students were positive regarding perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, better performance, and were able to achieve good achievement during the tests. The survey results reveal that the gamified flip-class setting fostered better motivation and engagement. Particularly, students motivated to compete and beat other students during the gamification activities by collecting points and badges as many as possible. Four main themes emerged from the qualitative interviews, namely, (1) pre-class learning motivation, (2) pre-class competition, (3) students' learning autonomy, and (4) students' social engagement. Conclusions from this study showed that the gamified flip-class setting had successfully constructed the basic psychological needs of SDT, namely: competency, autonomy, and relatedness.

TI Fostering the use of online learning resources: results of using a

AB Over the past years, higher education institutions have been exploring different mechanisms to adapt their learning and teaching practices to increase students' engagement. One of the proposals has been to reuse Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) as Small Online Private Courses (SPOCs), or as complementary resources in traditional courses through blended learning practices, such as flipped classroom. However, the integration of online courses as a complement to face-to-face courses poses some challenges. First, students are not used to such blended learning approaches and it is generally difficult for teachers to motivate them to access online resources for the preparation of face-to-face sessions. Second, students are not used to the dynamics of blended learning scenarios, which are less teacher-centered and require their active participation. We propose the use of the mobile application MyMOOCSpace (MMS) to meet these challenges and increase students' motivation and use of learning resources in blended learning courses that use SPOCs as a complement. MMS is a mobile learning application based on gamification mechanisms to promote collaboration and motivation of students in the use of digital resources as a complement to blended learning courses. In this paper, we present the results of a quasi-experiment in a blended course with 294 students that uses a SPOC as a complement, with the aim to assess the effect of MMS on students' motivation and learning resources consumption. In particular, the behavior of two groups of students with the main digital resources of the SPOC (videos and formative assessments) was analyzed: one using the MMS (GTest group), and the other not using MMS (GTrad group). The results suggest that the use of MMS had a positive correlation with the videos consumption, besides increasing student' interaction with assessment exercises in the SPOC.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe how the game-based learning is working in academic context, how we have used it and what kind of experiences we have got of it. One of the objectives of using serious games for formative purposes is to help students to improve their learning and thinking skills. This paper presents how a practical laboratory within the curricula of "Knitting and Clothing Technology" BSc program at the Faculty of Textiles, Leather and Industrial Management from Iasi, Romania, have been taught experimentally through the game-based learning method. The game was designed in php and html programs. The user interface allows the player (student) to interact with game elements, for example: play, load/save, end game, options buttons, and exit. The interface also includes some built-in information: game name, variance, rules. At the end of game, the score and time consumed are given. The game was designed so that it can be used both for learning and for assessment. The new learning method was applied with two groups of twelve students each. Other two groups of students (considered as control groups) have studied using the usual method. The level of understanding through the acquisition of knowledge and abilities revealed the effects of the applied method. The paper gives an idea about teaching certain concepts and processes like those in knitting technology in the form of a game. Among the benefits from using games in learning that one can take into consideration are the followings: - the students were more interested and involved in their learning when playing the game than when were just sitting and listening. - the small-scale experiment may be replicated or adapted to other units within Knitting and Clothing Technology curricula which aim to equip students with clear understanding of technological processes.

   Engagement
AB In this paper, we consider an approach to supporting students of Computer Science as they embark upon their university studies. The transition to Computer Science can be challenging for students, and equally challenging for those teaching them. Issues that are unusual - if not unique - to teaching computing at this level include
   the wide variety in students background, varying from no prior experience to extensive development practice;
   the positives and negatives of dealing with self-taught hobbyists who may developed buggy mental models of the task in hand and are not aware of the problem;
   the challenge of getting students to engage with material that includes extensive practical element;
   the atypical profile of a computing cohort, with typically 80%+ male students.
   The variation in background includes the style of prior academic experience, with some students coming from traditional level 3 (i.e. A-levels), some through more vocational routes (e.g. B-Tech, though these have changed in recent years), through to those from experiential (work based) learning. Technical background varies from science, mathematical and computing experience, to no direct advanced technical or scientific experience.
   A further issue is students' attainment and progression within higher education, where the success and outcomes in computer science has been identified as particularly problematic. Computer Science has one the worst records for retention (i.e. students leaving with no award, or a lower award than that originally applied for), and the second worst for attainment (i.e. achieving a good degree, that being defined as a first or a 2:1).
   One way to attempt to improve these outcomes is by identifying effective ways to improve student engagement. This can be through appropriate motivators - though then the balance of extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation becomes critical. In this paper, we consider how to utilize assessment - combining the formative and summative aspects - as a substitute for coarser approaches based on attendance monitoring.

AB There is great potential in making assessment and learning complementary. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of developing a desktop virtual reality (VR) laboratory simulation on the topic of genetics, with integrated assessment using multiple choice questions based on item response theory (IRT) and feedback based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. A pre-test post-test design was used to investigate three research questions related to: (1) students' perceptions of assessment in the form of MC questions within the VR genetics simulation; (2) the fit of the MC questions to the assumptions of the partial credit model (PCM) within the framework of IRT; and (3) if there was a significant increase in intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and transfer from pre- to post-test after using the VR genetics simulation as a classroom learning activity. The sample consisted of 208 undergraduate students taking a medical genetics course. The results showed that assessment items in the form of gamified multiple-choice questions were perceived by 97% of the students to lead to higher levels of understanding, and only 8% thought that they made the simulation more boring. Items within a simulation were found to fit the PCM and the results showed that the sample had a small significant increase in intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, and a large significant increase in transfer following the genetics simulation. It was possible to develop assessments for online educational material and retain the relevance and connectedness of informal assessment while simultaneously serving the communicative and credibility-based functions of formal assessment, which is a great challenge facing education today.

ID GAMIFICATION
AB Gamification, the use of game attributes in non-game context, is used in the private sector as well as education[1]. Research into Gamified Learning (GL) often focuses on case studies of impact or value [2], and can suffer from a lack of parsimony(Landers, 2014). The results are frameworks for gamified learning with limited or unclear practical applications and even less research on how to "gamify". However, consistent among this research are intersections with research in Student Engagement (SE). This presentation describes how a study on gamification's impact on SE produced an unintentional by-product - a way to create GL without extensive knowledge of gamification, and potentially serving research with a testable technique for "gamifying" in Higher Education (HE).
   Existing means for observing GL were insufficient for our study, so we sought to create one via a synthesis of frameworks. First, Bedwell's taxonomy of "game attributes" (GA's) isolates and describes the basic parts of any game [3]. This helps to identify the presence of GA's in learning. Next, the use of those GA's must conform to a definition of GL that's rigorous enough to be measured. Landers "Theory of Gamified Learning" (ToGL), contextualises GL as an intervention that identifies, extracts, and embeds GA's into learning [4] where GA's, instructional content, and students' "behaviours and attitudes" (B/A's) work together to affect learning. Encouragingly, much of the individual B/A's described in the ToGL are SE concepts. If SE can stand in for B/A's in the ToGL, then SE research may hold the key gamification.
   For this, we turned to Ella Kahu's consolidation of multiple SE frameworks in HE [5]. This breaks SE down into measurable variable-states ideal for Landers' B/A's, completing our framework for observing GL's impact on SE. However, in the process, Kahu's work also implies that relationships between GA's and SE variable-states are explainable by many learning theories. In which case, almost any learning theory could be used to select GA's to target SE variable-states, using our newly completed observational framework. Rather than observing GL, you could create it.
   The result is a step-by-step methodology for gamifying formative assessments. Here, Kahu's SE framework is mapped onto a player's engagement (PE) with a game, and a learning theory of their choice explains how it's GA's affect (PE), and thus SE. This allows for the identification, extraction, and embedding of game attributes, targeting SE for learning. The methodology is already in test phases with staff members at Edinburgh Napier University.

AB The Internet can be witnessed as a double-edged sword for learning purpose. Teachers and students can get supports from the tremendous amount of information that is effortlessly accessible to them. Internet has turn into the reckless and competent tool for educational and research purpose. However it has many negative effects also. The main disadvantage of internet is spending more time on social networking sites, playing online games, plagiarism in assignments etc. Internet has also changed the way teaching methods were adopted by traditional classroom teaching. Playing games has been considered as one of the major disadvantage of the Internet. Students are very likely to get attracted towards the some interesting games. Typical to their life style, students are increasingly seeking more interesting and engaging class room environment rather than boring traditional class room teaching. This gives an idea of why not design and use educational games similar to one popular in internet and television shows so that they don't have to sacrifice their interest (hobby) and also involve themselves into learning activity. Convincing students to study material is regularly frustrating and challenging task for the teachers. Lack of interest develops increasingly evident as class time goes by, with students staring at the clock. To overcome these problems, we have to design a game with learning outcome. While playing the game student must have gained some kind of understanding and information. Let say we have designed such game, and then next question is how to use and where to deploy those games so that maximum number of users can be get benefit from that. Integrating the technologies available in the existing class rooms and open source learning management system Moodle as platform to deploy and play educational games entertainingly. This paper explains about integrating technology and games similar to the most popular TV show "Who will be a millionaire" and interesting classroom evaluation methods to actively engage students in classroom activities which can enhance their learning in higher education

AB This article presents the results from a study evaluating two types of games in the game-based learning platform Kahoot! Quiz and Jumble. When playing the Quiz game, the goal for the students is to choose one out of four answers as quickly as possible, and the score is awarded for a correct answer and how fast the answer is given. When playing the Jumble game, the goal is to arrange four answers in a correct sequence, and the score is awarded for a correct sequence and the amount of time used to answer. The quasi-experiment was carried out in a software architecture course at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 59 participants. The experiment took place at the end of five 45-minute lectures on Software Quality attributes, where the two games were used to summarize the topic. Both the Quiz and the Jumble games were created in the same fashion where the goal was to map given statements to named software quality attributes. First, the students played through half of the summary questions using the Quiz game, and then they played through the remaining half using the Jumble game. The students were observed during both games and answered a survey after they had played both games (53 complete responses). The results presented are based on observations and a survey that includes both qualitative and quantitative data. The focus of the survey was on which of the two games the students perceived as most entertaining, most engaging, most motivating, required most concentration, and from which one they learned the most. They were also asked to give comments related to the experience. The results of the study show that both games were perceived to be equally fun, motivating, and provide the same perceived learning effect. However, the Jumble game was perceived to be more engaging and demanded higher concentration from the students. Several suggestions were also provided on how to improve the Jumble game.

AB The process of integration of technology into education involves many tools and applications to be used in the classroom and outside teaching processes today. 'Kahoot' is one of such student response systems and one of the primary applications that can be utilised for the purposes such as gamification, formative assessment and peer learning procedures. Such applications are widely used for the purposes of bringing a gamification in the education industry nowadays. The primary purpose of this research is to determine the opinions of teachers who are active in the education industry and their experience in using 'Kahoot' as a teaching aid in bringing the diversification in the industry. In this study, a semi-structured interview form was used as a data collection tool. Opinions of prospective teachers participating in the study was taken into consideration to form an end conclusion of this research study. The research data also involves a semi-structured student opinion form, and a procedure of content analysis was undertaken in the analysis of the data. The study group of the research consists of 38 teacher candidates studying in Kazan (Volga region) Federal University, Institute of Legislation and Comparative Law under the Government of the Russian Federation, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics and Sechenov University. As a result of the study performed over the set of teachers and students, it was concluded that the 'Kahoot' program is widely beneficial for students and teachers. It was also concluded that the Kahoot program is helpful in eliminating the deficiencies in learning. However, one of the shortcomings of the 'Kahoot' program is that it is an internet-based programme. Hence it may be problematic for some of the students to use the programme who have less knowledge in the internet domain. At the end of the study, a positive set of opinions about the Kahoot program was suggested, which majorly revolved around the idea that the programme is not internet based.

AB The use of Gamification tools for the evaluation of acquisition of competences in other formative stages has given excellent results. However, its application in the final year degree activities, such as Final Year Project (FYP), is still a challenge with great advantages to explore. This work proposes the use of gamification tools for the implementation and evaluation of the acquisition of Respect to the Environment in the development of FYP in the School of Civil Engineering of the UPM.
   A set of badges is designed to be awarded the students after the achievement of certain milestones related to the acquisition of certain skills, such as the inclusion of methodologies with low environmental impact in the project, the study of social impact, evaluation of alternatives with low environmental impact, etc. In addition, special badges are created to recognize the performance of specific training activities in this field that are carried out outside the school, such as attending talks on the subject and conducting training courses (MOOCs), with the aim of encouraging the participation of students in this type of activities. In parallel, as an attempt to contextualize the outcome acquisition process during realization the FYP, we present here the Project-teca, an interactive project database in which a set of FYPs have been classified and systematically cataloged.
   A methodology for assessing the acquisition of the competence Respect for the Environment during the development of the FYP has been developed. Tutors and evaluators were consulted about the usual practice in FYP tutoring and criteria used to make the final assessment. The existence of an organized and objective method for evaluation improves the student's planning and the monitoring of the evolution by the tutor. It also allows a more objective evaluation by the assessors.
   All these actions have improved the tutorship between the students and their project coordinators, providing valuable information on the FYP students concerns and the outcomes acquired, establishing the criteria for transparency in evaluation methods at such an important and significant stage as FYP.

DE higher education; gamification; workshop
AB Educational innovations have focused on the need for immediate learning feedback and student involvement. Gamification is defined as the incorporation of game mechanics, such as levels or quests into non-game activities, to promote learning episodes that would give learners low risk ways to assess their own capabilities and to create an environment in which effort is rewarded. During the game session, a failure can be (partially) rectified and becomes an opportunity to learn thus, the negative anxiety of the students to fail is reduced. We have designed a pilot workshop as a review activity for a large classroom in the module on Digestive Pathophysiology within Molecular Pathophysiology subject, coursed during the third year of the Pharmaceutical Degree at the University of Castilla-La Mancha. This workshop aims to put into practice the concepts seen during the theoretical sessions, favouring logic and reason over memorization.
   The training workshop included two parts, one focused on fast and individual reasoning and the second part aimed to elaborate teamwork/group reasoning.
   Part One: It included 10/15 multiple-choice response questions with discussion about digestive pathophysiology, assessed by individual remote response system (clickers).
   Part two: In this part, gamification elements were incorporated, (such as game mechanics: point systems, countdown and challenges, for example to resolve a mystery, it's the unknown pathology) adapted from the popular board game "Guess who?" to find a specific digestive pathology. In our case, three hidden pathologies must be respectively discovered by three student's groups, playing the detective role (called as "Sherlock" groups, SG). To find the hidden pathology, SG have to gather clues.
   The rest of the students were organized in two "Patient" groups (PG). Every PG received a distinctive colored envelope in which they found specific information about each pathology:
   1. Initial clue (signs, symptoms, clinical features, etc.).
   2. Pathology name.
   3. Chief or key question.
   To discover the pathology, SG must ask to PG questions about the results of laboratory tests, physical examinations or features that would help SG to suspect pathology, while discarding others. To arrive at a "possible diagnostic", a key question must be done by SG to differentiate/distinguish pathologies that have common symptoms.
   The dynamics of the workshop are as follows:
   1. Each SG chooses a PG. Then, the envelope is opened and the first clue is read out load.
   2. The PG chosen is given 15 minutes to analyze the problem, thinking on possible indicators that can provide a diagnosis and reasoning to elaborate proper answers to probable questions asked by SG.
   3. The SG is given 15 minutes to elaborate four questions that would allow the "diagnosis" and to rule out other alternatives.
   When SG is able to figure out the pathology using four questions (or less), they are rewarded with 8 points. If the Key Question is one of those, SG get two extra points and the maximum score. One point is deducted for every additional question needed. Earned points by SG members are used in final evaluation of the subject for SG and PG members.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reflections of gamification activities that are used as a formative assessment tool based on academic achievement and student engagement in learning environments. It was also aimed to investigate whether the utilization of the gamification tool led to a difference in academic achievement and student engagement. Three research groups were determined; two experimental groups where 7E instructional model gamified with Kahoot and Quizizz was implemented and a control group where conventional 7E instruction method was implemented. The groups were determined by random assignment of 97 pre-service teachers who took scientific research methods course in the 2017-2018 academic year spring semester. However, since only 71 of the assigned pre-service teachers voluntarily participated in the study, the study data included 71 pre-service teachers. At the beginning and the end of the six-week-long instruction activities, the academic achievement test and student engagement scale on the content instructed in the six-week-long scientific research methods course were applied. Furthermore, in-depth views of pre-service teachers were obtained with focus group interviews. Therefore, the study was conducted with mixed design principles. The study findings demonstrated that the scientific research methods academic achievement x student engagement x group interaction model (Wilks's lambda =.819, F-[2,F- 66] = 7.301, p < 0.05) was significant. The activities gamified with Kahoot application, albeit statistically insignificant, had a more positive impact on academic achievement and student engagement when compared to the other groups. On the other hand, it was observed that the positive impact of the activities gamified with Quizizz application was lower than that of the instruction method utilized in the control group both based on academic achievement (Delta<(X)over bar>(pretest-post-testquitizz) = 38.116, Delta(X) over bar (pretest-post-testcontrol) = 38.776) and student engagement (Delta(X) over bar (pretest-posttestqutzit). = 12.176, ARpretest-postm5 o,01 = 14.218). Opposed to quantitative findings, pre-service teachers expressed views about the problems they experienced under the sub themes of motivation, reinforcement, entertainment, competition sub-themes in gamification activities and stated that they were generally positive about the activities and experienced problems related to the infrastructure and the tool.

AB Tertiary institutions are increasingly providing hybrid delivery options to students, requiring course coordinators to migrate formerly face-to-face curricula into frameworks that suit online teaching. However, there is a risk that the implementation of hands-on, engaging activities will decrease during hybrid sessions due to staff uncertainty of their effectiveness across the varied cohorts. This presents a need to identify engaging modes of instruction that can remain equally engaging for learning regardless of the students' enrolled mode of delivery. Interactive polling has the potential to be used within a class in real-time and allow both face-to-face and online students to take part in an in-class activity at the same time. This study aimed to compare the effects of interactive polling within either a face-to-face or online delivery format. One-hundred and seventy-four participants studying first-year health science and medicine completed a live interactive poll using the Kahoot! platform in either a face-to-face (n=72) or online (n=102) hybrid-delivered subject. Experiences and perceptions were provided as written responses and a Likert scale survey. Participant responses were positive, with three themes emerging, including interactive polling being enjoyable, engaging, and valuable for learning. Across cohorts, participants rated interactive polling highly, and perceived that it offered an effective learning and revision tool. This study found that interactive polling using Kahoot! maintains its suitability as a method of instruction across both face-to-face and online learner cohorts. The finding that it remains equally effective across both delivery modes provides evidence-based support for its use in hybrid or blended subject offerings.
   Practitioner Notes
   1. Many traditionally face-to-face teaching-focussed universities have recently migrated to a hybrid provision of educational material.
   2. It is unclear which methods used to promote student engagement and interactivity in face-to-face sessions would translate well to delivery in an entirely or partially online course.
   3. Interactive polling is well-suited for transition between face-to-face or online, with the benefits and learner perceptions retained regardless of the mode of delivery.
   4. This study provides evidence to support educators wishing to embed interactive polling within either face-to-face, online, or hybrid lessons.

ID FEEDBACK
AB Peer review is increasingly used in higher education, also at Delft University of Technology. Unfortunately, the potential of student-student feedback often appears to be undervalued, making it less effective. The quality of the reviews is not as good and they are less constructive than expected. Moreover, not all students take giving and or receiving feedback serious. Since 2005 the peer review process in the course Preparation Master Thesis has been continuously developing with the aim to increase the contribution of constructive feedback to the learning process.
   In the course students learn the essential academic skills to write a research proposal. More than 1200 students have participated so far. Our objective is to support students in developing a suitable and feasible research design. For intermediary feedback on drafts and formative assessment, peer review (PR) is an essential element of this course. In the first years of the course the PR procedure was similar as well known in academic and other professional circles: students received collegial informal peer review of their ideas in class, and a more formal written peer review of the full draft of the deliverable. From 2012 the course was also offered fully online. Without class meetings, and far less student-teacher interaction the peer review procedure became more critical for the students' learning experience, since informal interaction was hardly arranged. Continuous evaluation led to adaptation of the peer review process in the course.
   In this paper we reflect on the improvements that we have made over the years:
   to consider feedback seriously: rebut and asses the reviews
   to learn how to give constructive feedback: introduce a repeated review process, evaluating the reviews and assessing the rebuttal
   to structure feedback: using an assessment form, later a rubric
   to reduce peer pressure: using an anonymous review
   to improve trust, confidence and comfort: experiments with peer groups
   Based on the most recent lessons learned we will discuss our latest project integrating the peer review process in a game-based learning environment. Based on the data and experience from the previous course runs we assume that game incentives will improve learning results as students are encouraged to engage in the interactive peer review process and further their professional behaviour giving constructive feedback. We aim to make this into an adaptable learning format for any programme that wishes to adopt a similar approach to increase the learning experience and effect of peer review.

   methodology
AB Using games is a new and a powerful way of learning in the classrooms, where students are active participants in the learning process. Educational games empower students' knowledge and skills, as well as educational value of the teaching process. There are plenty of serious games that can be used in education, but most of them simply do not hold interest among students. Thus, the students do not really accept them as games, which creates opposite effect than expected. There are other factors that influence the successful game's integration in the classroom - teachers' digital competences, technical (pre)requirements for the game, educational value of the game.
   This paper presents a methodological tool based on an evaluation framework for integration of digital games into education (MEDGE). The evaluation framework uses different data gathering techniques such as: surveys, exams, observation, reflection, in order to obtain data. This methodological tool is simplified version of an evaluation framework, developed to act as a subjective, but efficient tool for teachers in order to make initial evaluation of the potential introduction of certain educational game in the classroom.
   The tool establishes step by step methodology for evaluation of educational games. It starts with determining the technical requirements of a game, accordance to students' age and teachers' digital competences needed to play it in the classroom. If these conditions are met, the game evaluation continues by determining game's ease of use, its educational value, students' quality of experience, game's alignment with educational goals and teacher subjective preferences toward using the game in the classroom.
   The proposed methodology was tested by more than 62 teachers from Croatia, Macedonia, Norway, Estonia, Germany and Poland. The teachers were asked to evaluate at least two educational games using this methodological tool. One of those games was Kahoot, a popular game within the teachers' community. Kahoot is a quiz based game that can be used for initial, formative and summative assessment of students' knowledge using individual or collaborative team work mode. The other game was selected by teachers based on their needs and experiences.
   Using a survey with five-point Likert scale, information concerning teachers' attitudes towards usefulness of the methodology, its complexity, applicability in the classroom, and usefulness for evaluation of a game were obtained. The participants had the opportunity to give comments and express their opinion concerning the proposed methodological tool. The paper is consisted of detailed description of the developed methodological approach, together with the use cases and results of the survey on usage of the methodological evaluation tool.

DE game based learning; serious games; intrinsic motivation; instructional
   design
AB During the past two years we developed a physics game following a unique design principle. Many educational games currently available on the market solely focus on knowledge transfer following a behaviourist principle (Annetta, 2010). The learner is confronted with more or less demanding tasks which are solved using the trial and error method (Skinner, 1938). Learning success is directly assessed using a simple feedback system ("right", "wrong"). Furthermore the audio visual quality of interactive learning software often can't keep up with video games today's target group has become accustomed to. We decided to take a different path. Since fun of play is considered as one of the key elements of an elaborated game playing experience (Vorderer et al., 2004), we decided to design a fun filled and action packed learning game built around a serious topic: renewable energies. The content of the game is based on the physics curriculum while the graphical and audio visual quality of "Ludwig" was designed to stand a comparison with common triple a games. We crafted the game using the powerful open source software Unity. This tool empowered us to create an immersive game environment which was inspired by the look and feel of World of Warcraft. A simple formula "learning goal = game goal" defined the core game mechanics. Based on a constructivist paradigm "Ludwig" offers challenges in an interactive 3d world while learning takes place in an authentic context (McLellan, 1985). Players are allowed to explore the game world, to experiment in virtual laboratories and to solve problems freely while their actions directly lead to consequences and positive feedback by the game. The players actions leave a trace in the game world fostering individual experiences of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977). Numerous feedback iterations with the target group consisting of students and teachers secured a satisfying level of quality regarding the learning content, the gameplay and the look & feel of "Ludwig". We decided to use an iterative design principle which empowers players to become game designers (Wagner, 2009). By applying qualitative and quantitative methods we gained insights in the applicability of variable quality assurance strategies. Students reflected on the playability of the game, on the usability of the interface and finally on motivational aspects (learning motivation, interest for physics). Teachers reflected on the potential benefits and problems of using "Ludwig" in class. The results of the formative (quality assurance workshops) as well as the summative evaluation (assessment of motivational, cognitive and learning processes) show that "Ludwig" can foster learning processes if game based learning is combined with established teaching methods and material.

TI Are quiz-games an effective revision tool in Anatomical Sciences for
   Higher Education and what do students think of them?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently, there has been an increased volume of pedagogical research and practice of mobile learning (m-learning) and gameplay in education. This paper presents the findings of a study that examined the effect on achievement and explored student perception towards quiz-game play prior to an anatomy assessment in first year Higher Education students. Achievement data was collected over two academic years at all module assessment (A1-A4) points. A1 was used as a baseline, showing no difference between groups or years, A2 and A3 were comparable online assessments done on the lower and upper limbs that followed the same format; A4 was a viva-voce to assess the whole module learning. The optional 15-minute quiz-gameplay intervention (G) using a mobile application was initiated prior to A3, those students who chose not to participate performed their traditional study routine; no other changes to assessments were made resulting in a Gameplay and non-gameplay (G, NG) group for each year. Students were invited to participate in an online focus group (N = 84) and a sample undertook in-depth interviews (N = 9) to gain qualitative data on their perceptions of the intervention. Students who participated in the gameplay (G) group (N = 87) demonstrated a significant improvement in A3 compared to A2, and the non-game play (NG) group (N = 164) a significant decrease. A thematic analysis was undertaken on the focus group and interview data revealing key aspects of quiz-gameplay as a learning tool. This paper offers insight into the potential benefit of encouraging m-learning gameplay as part of revision or learning for anatomy students. This information could help educators and study support facilitate efficient revision methods as well as initiate further research into the use of anatomy gameplay to enhance the student learning experience.
   Practitioner Notes
   What is already known about this topic
   Repeated and formative quizzing can help memory or knowledge retention.
   Gameplay can help student engagement, learning and flow depending on the game in question.
   What this paper adds
   Using mobile app-based quiz-games prior to an anatomy assessment can improve student achievement.
   Students tend to play mobile app-based quiz-games whilst commuting on public transport, in their free time at home and at university.
   Elements of mobile app-based quiz-games students identified as important are that they are interactive, allow competition, are visually appealing, provide instant feedback, are user friendly and are facilitated by the teacher.
   Implications for practice
   Educators should encourage mobile app-based quiz-games to increase short-term learning or revision.
   Educators should facilitate mobile learning quiz-game opportunities to encourage learning outside of the classroom.
   Educators wanting to integrate mobile app-based quiz-games in their classes should use the game attributes identified in this study.
